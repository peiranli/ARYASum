# ARYASum

This repository contains the code of our summarization model ARYASum which is an end-to-end ARYA based model.

Currently, the source code is in jupyter notebook format. 

We will release the python script version in the future. 

Before training the model, please use ARYA(github.com/peiranli/ARYA) to train the word embedding model and aspect classification model first.
