They fit great
Great price
They seem pretty solid to me.
They are very light weight & fairly comfortable.
The color & style is wonderful!
No support in the heel.
they deflate and make an annoying squish sound.
Very disappointed in the quality of these.
Very uncomfortable and feet
Very hard insole
they're just slightly too large in the foot area,
