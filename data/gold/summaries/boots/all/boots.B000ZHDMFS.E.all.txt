I really love the design of this shoe and the 360 degrees venting concept.
The foot bed has memory foam,
and there is no break in time necessary.
Fit as expected, true to size and extremely comfortable.
Nice looking shoes.
This shoe hurts.
the inside lining is awful and hurt my feet,
It is way too sloppy for my foot.
Also the red is not a bright red, but more of a rust.
and the shoe is a little tight, width wise.
They are pretty heavy too.
