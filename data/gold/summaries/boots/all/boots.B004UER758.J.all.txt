Very cute
The shoe its self is stylish,
They are a comfortable fit on width, but a little long in length.
the attention to detail is great!
So well made so very comfortable!
They do not fit well, are horribly uncomfortable
and make a squeaky noise no matter what type of floor you are walking on.
if you don't mind a little discomfort and blisters.
The ankle is a little too large
They are too big even with heavy socks,
the fringe was all crazy and going in every which direction,
