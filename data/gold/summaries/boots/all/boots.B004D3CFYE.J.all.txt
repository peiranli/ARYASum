I liked these shoes for the fit and comfort.
And they are waterproof!!
I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support
It's very sturdy and helped steady my ankles
Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,
that protects your feet
and keep them warm.
Long story short, they are anything but waterproof.
and wore it 2 times
before the seam came apart from the sole.
They are very uncomfortable in the foot bed.
these shoes definately run small.
