These boots have a sturdy, comfortable sole with a heel
that is easy to walk on
and ample toe room,
I really love these boots.
They fit perfectly
but these were way too narrow in the foot and the shaft.
I could not even zip this boot up
and it did not have much stretch to it at all!
Also, the sole of the boot was very rigid and unforgiving to the the arches of my feet, thus major uncomfort
Too big and baggy on my skinny calves.
The material is very thin and flimsy
