and they fit perfectly.
They seem pretty solid to me.
These boots are exactly as pictured.
They are very light weight & fairly comfortable.
Very comfy and stylish.
Size it true to fit also!
No support in the heel.
but the sole is made of a cheap material
Cute but terrible quality
they deflate and make an annoying squish sound.
Very uncomfortable and feet
hurt after 30 minutes
Very hard insole
they're just slightly too large in the foot area,
