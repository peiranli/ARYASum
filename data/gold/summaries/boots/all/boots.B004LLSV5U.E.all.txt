While they are very cute
These fit well
and they are comfortable.
These have a fairly good sole, good support, and of course great warmth, especially for synthetic insulating materials.
They appear to be very well made
The price was perfect for me.
The boots in person don't have the same look as in the picture.
the shafts are narrow and very very hard to put on.
they are very difficult to slip on and take off.
