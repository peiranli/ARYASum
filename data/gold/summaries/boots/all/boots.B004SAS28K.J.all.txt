The boot looks great.
The comfort exceeds the slight hassle.
True to size, soft suede especially on ankle area, superb FitFlop comfort
and casual,
but they do stretch
and bruises the top of the foot!
The buckle is only for looks,
I couldn't even get them on to see how they looked
Would recommend getting 1 size larger.
There is friction with the suede inside
If you have a wide foot,
these are NOT the boots for you.
