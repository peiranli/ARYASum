These boots look good and fit great,
they have a nice thick sole with good tread.
It has pretty good traction for a rainy day
I love the color and craftsmanship of this boot,
They fit very comfortably, even with thicker socks.
Great fit, however my socks were soaked the first time
I wore them out in the rain.
Plus the insole was oversized
and would have to be trimmed.
