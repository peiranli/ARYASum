They do have good ankle support however
The boots are waterproof and fully lined ; very warm!
These fit well
and they are comfortable.
They appear to be very well made
and my feet got really wet and cold.
The boots in person don't have the same look as in the picture.
the shafts are narrow and very very hard to put on.
I have to get two size larger
I just wish
the heel piece wasn't so hard ;
Untying them doesn't help/work
as that is just part of the boots looks.
