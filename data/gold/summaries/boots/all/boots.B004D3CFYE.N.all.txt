These are extremely comfortable boots,
these shoes really are comfortable with no break in time required.
And they are waterproof!!
I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support
These boots are awesome!
Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,
that protects your feet
and keep them warm.
Long story short, they are anything but waterproof.
They are very uncomfortable in the foot bed.
Obviously, a poorly made shoe or inferior materials.
They were waterproof at first,
but after wearing them for a few months they became quite leaky.
