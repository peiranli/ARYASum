:) they are wonderful contructed boots but very small.
They do have good ankle support however
The boots are waterproof and fully lined ; very warm!
Great color and good warmth.
They appear to be very well made
and are comfortable to wear around.
The price was perfect for me.
they are very difficult to slip on and take off.
Of course it takes a little time to lace up,
