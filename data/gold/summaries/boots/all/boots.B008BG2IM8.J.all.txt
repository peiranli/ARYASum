well made
The soft pillow cushion, wide heel, and soft-arch make them the perfect all-day shoe.
The insoles are quite cushioned
and they look and feel great.
they are NOT wide.
that don't fit.
They killed my feet!
The toe box is quite narrow,
They also look cheap,
This shoe is snug
However, I would order one size larger than normal.
