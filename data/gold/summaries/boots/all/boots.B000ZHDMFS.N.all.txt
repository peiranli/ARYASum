They look great,
and they are comfortable to wear around the house but not for actually walking.
I really love the design of this shoe and the 360 degrees venting concept.
Fit as expected, true to size and extremely comfortable.
This shoe hurts.
the inside lining is awful and hurt my feet,
It is way too sloppy for my foot.
