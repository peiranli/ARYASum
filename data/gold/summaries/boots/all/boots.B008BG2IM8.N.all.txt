I absolutely love the style
These shoes are very comfortable and cute.
They're very good quality.
The soft pillow cushion, wide heel, and soft-arch make them the perfect all-day shoe.
The insoles are quite cushioned
and they look and feel great.
Normally ordering my size in a wide works very well,
they didn't fit properly.
hurt after a wearing the shoes a few hours.
