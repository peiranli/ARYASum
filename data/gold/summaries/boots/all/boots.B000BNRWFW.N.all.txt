They look great, seem to be well made, however,
They are very comfortable
and provide the protection
I need.
Advertised as leather,
but is in fact a cloth backed synthetic!
that is not soft at all.
and it's taking longer
to break them in.
that they came
without any type of cushioning???
and I also feel tough with the steel toe.
