Fitflop has such great soles for the footwear
The size was right
The boot looks great.
They are cozy warm and comfortable
There is friction with the suede inside
True to size, soft suede especially on ankle area, superb FitFlop comfort
but they do stretch
but these are so awkward to try to put on,
it requires a shoe horn
and bruises the top of the foot!
so they don't go on easily.
