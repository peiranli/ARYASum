They are awesome looking
Well made and just something different to wear.
The colour is beautiful
the attention to detail is great!
So well made so very comfortable!
They do not fit well, are horribly uncomfortable
and make a squeaky noise no matter what type of floor you are walking on.
The seam on the top of the foot sits too low and rubs against the top of the foot.
These were very narrow.
They are too big even with heavy socks,
