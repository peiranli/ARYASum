These boots look good and fit great,
they have a nice thick sole with good tread.
It has pretty good traction for a rainy day
They are very sturdy
and keep the rain out.
not only are they cute but super comfortable and very durable.
most of one day my feet never hurt and never got wet...
These run small
if you have bigger calves
they won't fit
Also, the buckles at the top are pretty much there for decoration
and sometimes would come out of the buckles
Plus the insole was oversized
that they kind of smell
