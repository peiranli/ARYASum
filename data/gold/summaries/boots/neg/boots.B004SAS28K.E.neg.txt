This boot has nothing to unzip or anything flexible to make it possible to get the boot on your foot.
Ridiculous design.
The buckle is only for looks,
There is friction with the suede inside
so they don't go on easily.
These do not have a fuzzy warm interior.
I would not suggest wearing them in a heavy rain,
