these shoes really are comfortable with no break in time required.
And they are waterproof!!
I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support
The color is nice, more light blue than purple.
Definitely worth the money.
It's very sturdy and helped steady my ankles
Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,
