Cons : Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.
A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service.
BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction.
The power cord is short.
Bags fill up quickly
The floor attachment is to big.
The attachments are easily knocked off the wand.
The handle is a little thick and slightly difficult to use.
