Cons : Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.
BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction.
the tools keep falling off.
The crevice brush is not long enough
the cord is too short
and didn't retract well.
Bags fill up quickly
It is hard to control
It does seem to shut down
while using it.
