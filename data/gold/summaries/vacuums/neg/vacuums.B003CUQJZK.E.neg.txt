I recently contacted Miele customer service
which is absolutely horrible!
The design of this newer version is poor
The power cord is too short.
that it is quite heavy
to move around and constantly overturns
the electric power head for carpet not very wide and powerful and it tips over easily.
that there's no on-board storage for the parquet floor attachment
The bag hold very little,
