This cleaned the carpet really well and
This also performed better on the tile and vinyl floors that on the hardwood.
I love the cleaning sensor.
It's super easy to empty the dirt
and clean the filters.
Easy assembly with just one screw.
Real long cord gets around the house.
it has the best suction of any upright
I like the fact its bagless,
and the price is right
It's not too noisy
