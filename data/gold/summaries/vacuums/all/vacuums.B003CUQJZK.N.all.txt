It's very light, quiet and easy to move.
It has really good suction
the various attachments really do their job,
It looses suction
when the vacuum bag is only half full
The power cord is too short.
The bags are small.
They fill up quickly,
that it is quite heavy
to move around and constantly overturns
the electric power head for carpet not very wide and powerful and it tips over easily.
