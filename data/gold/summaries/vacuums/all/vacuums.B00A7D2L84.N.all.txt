It's light and easy to handle.
Picks up cat hair and kitty litter easily.
It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.
The suction is excellent and adjustable to my needs.
It has absolutely no suction power.
The vacuum stop
working couple of times due to it
was overheated.
Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke
The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use.
