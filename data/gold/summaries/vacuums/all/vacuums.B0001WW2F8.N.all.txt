This cleaned the carpet really well and
pulled up a shocking amount of crud and dust.
It's super easy to empty the dirt
and clean the filters.
Real long cord gets around the house.
It's not too noisy
and it does a great job.
Its heavy and cumbersome
The suction is WEAK,
Also it is very loud
I have had continuous problems with the belt
breaking or burning.
