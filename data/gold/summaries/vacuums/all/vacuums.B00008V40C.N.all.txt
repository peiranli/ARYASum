The Power Stick has great suction
It does a good job though with cat hair and bits of kitty litter.
It's very lightweight
and has a nice long cord.
It is incredibly noisy,
It has below average perfomance on tile or wood floors
and is totally useless on carpet.
that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum.
