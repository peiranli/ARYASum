Love the bagless design and good performance.
It's light and easy to handle.
Picks up cat hair and kitty litter easily.
It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.
The power brush is amazing.
The suction is excellent and adjustable to my needs.
It has absolutely no suction power.
The dust bag and all snappers are so flimsy
This vacuum is cheaply made,
Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke
to remove hair and string
you have to remove several screws
The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use.
