This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors
It has onboard tools
the retractable cord makes it so much easier,
and emptying it is a snap.
It is so lightweight
The suction is very good.
The hose and the power cord is very short!
and it doesn't vacuum anything up on both the tile and the rugs.
And pet hair?
Forget it.
The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -
but lint gets stuck on the little bottom wheels.
