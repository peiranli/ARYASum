This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors
The cord retracts
It has onboard tools
and emptying it is a snap.
It is so lightweight
From carpet to floor, it does an excellent job.
The hose and the power cord is very short!
and it doesn't vacuum anything up on both the tile and the rugs.
It dosen't produce much suction
The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -
