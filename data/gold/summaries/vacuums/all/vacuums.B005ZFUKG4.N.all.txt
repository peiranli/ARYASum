it is light -
it is powerful
and works wonderfully.
Great to get in small corners, counters, furniture.
The suction is superb ;
I was delighted with the handling of this vacuum,
it is so easy to maneuver.
Missing hose extension and smelled of something burning
but it is so loud I can not even get through vacuuming my tile floors.
Brush head is small,
