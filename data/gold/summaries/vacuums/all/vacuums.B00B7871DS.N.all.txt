This Hoover is great on my wood floors,
the hose is easy to whip out and use,
and the vacuum is lightweight and maneuvers nicely.
It has good suction
The transition from carpet to hard wood floors is smooth.
The hose/handle attachment is great for getting to hard to reach places.
but all wraps around the brush
and is very difficult to be taking off all the time.
but it's heavy and hard to push, especially on large area rugs
And it's not very steerable.
