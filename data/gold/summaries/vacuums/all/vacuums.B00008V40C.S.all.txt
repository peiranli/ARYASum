its very powerful.
It's very lightweight
It picks up dirt
and long hair very well.
it can not jam with hair.
and has a nice long cord.
It is incredibly noisy,
It has below average perfomance on tile or wood floors
and is totally useless on carpet.
The dirt is just blown around
but the opening is only about 3 inches wide
but I wish
the handle was a little longer.
Keep in mind it does not have any extra tools or a rotating brush.
