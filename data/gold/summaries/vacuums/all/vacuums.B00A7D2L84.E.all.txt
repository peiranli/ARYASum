Love the bagless design and good performance.
It's light and easy to handle.
It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.
The power brush is amazing.
The sides " wrapped " with protective rubber like rim
It has absolutely no suction power.
The dust bag and all snappers are so flimsy
Not a quality machine and not worth the price.
Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke
that the attachments do not fit on the unit
