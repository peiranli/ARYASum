It is light weight and easy to maneuver.
This is little vacuum works absolutely terrific on low pile carpet and even bare tile floors!
It was easy to assemble,
But maneuvering is easy,
all the components are well built.
The filter and dirt compartment is easily detachable
Suction power is excellent!
The vacuum overheats
It is just poorly built.
the hose is way too short
You have to hold it at a very uncomfortable angle
it will not adjust to different carpet pile heights.
For me, however, just a little heavier than I thought.
It's not silent,
