The vacuum has good suction
It is lightweight
and by far, this is the best one for the money.
it is quieter than my Hoover,
the telescoping dust brush DOES work,

The spin duster does not really spin that great,
Too bulky, cord is unusually stiff and tangles are impossible to remove.
The attachments are not useful.
You do have to clean out filters often,
the extension wand falls off
