It does have plenty of power and suction.
It is light weight and easy to maneuver.
This is little vacuum works absolutely terrific on low pile carpet and even bare tile floors!
It was easy to assemble,
all the components are well built.
The filter and dirt compartment is easily detachable
For this price point, great value for quality you get.
It is just poorly built.
Then the motor became unbearably loud.
the hose is way too short
it will not adjust to different carpet pile heights.
For me, however, just a little heavier than I thought.
