It does have excellent suction however,
(even though I like the bagless feaure, light in weight and an OK price)
It's super easy to empty the dirt
and clean the filters.
Easy assembly with just one screw.
Real long cord gets around the house.
The dirt sensor works so well.
Its noisy and the filter blocks up
Its heavy and cumbersome
and does not last long belt wise.
The suction is WEAK,
this is really a poor design.
