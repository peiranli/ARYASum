The vacuum has good suction
and the brush attachment works great.
It is lightweight
and it is so convenient
to empty the dust cup
without having to clean the filter each time.
it just spits out the dirt.
It will not pick up anything
The hose attachments have very little power.
I am sadly disappointed in the quality.
The attachments are not useful.
