This keyboard looks very sleek
The backlit keys look great
The illumination of the keys is perfect.
The price is also right.
The keys are backlit in a soft blue
including volume buttons for the sound.
They keyboard has a great feel,
But the arrangement of this keyboard is absolutely awful,
which pretty severely reduces its usability.
and feel cheap.
because they made the keyboard compact
and cut the size of the back/delete key.
This is really annoying for non gaming or word
as you will miss the key often
