The keys had the perfect amount of tension,
the spacing was impeccable,
and the wrist rest was comfortable and stylish.
This keyboard is beautiful and sleek
Keys are light and easy to use,
layout is perfect,
programmable function keys are great.
Unfortunately it has many keys
that don't work.
The reception was sometimes spotty in registering clicks.
The spacebar rarely was recognized
