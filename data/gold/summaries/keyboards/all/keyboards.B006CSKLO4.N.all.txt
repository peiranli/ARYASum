It's cheap and a little quieter than a regular keyboard.
In general functionality is good for a simple small chiclet keyboard.
Very nice keyboard with very responsive keys.
It is comfortable to use,
and it is very reliable.
Also, at such a good price it is hard to beat!
It's not silent.
Keyboard seemed to occasionally miss button presses
and was just generally fairly inaccurate.
however the keyboard died for no reason after three weeks.
It also doesn't have the USB connection in the keyboard.
They're kinda loud,
