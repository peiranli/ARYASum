I liked ergonomics and the lightness
The keyboard itself has good reactivity
and is light and portable.
The layout is nice,
This is probably the most comfortable keyboard
The AAA batteries were included in the box,
The build
quality seems very good as well.
However, I am very, very disappointed in the durability of this product.
This keyboard is very hard to type on and will cause your wrists to ache.
The layout is a bit unusual
and will take a little
getting used to.
