Pros : works
as it should right out of the box.
Special feature keys
(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)
are handy.
This is a very nice keyboard for the price.
and has 2 USB 2. 0 ports.
Looks cheap but its not.
For me, that means fast, accurate typing.
Cons : noisy keys,
keyboard feels cheap,
key travel is shallow
it's just not comfortable or quiet.
Yes, it looks and feels cheap
and it's noisy to type on,
