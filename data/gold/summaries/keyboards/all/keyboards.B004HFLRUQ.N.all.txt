This keyboard was very nice looking
I like the size of this keyboard.
and works well enough.
It's small and attractive.
The price is right.
The keys are smooth
They click nicely.
It is never discoverable by the computer
it takes some time for it to wake up
Also key are a bit harder to press,
Also, too much lag
if you type fast.
only drawback is the on and off button is so tiny
that it is hard to slide,
