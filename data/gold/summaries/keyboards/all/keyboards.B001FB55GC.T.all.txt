The keys had the perfect amount of tension,
the spacing was impeccable,
and the wrist rest was comfortable and stylish.
This keyboard is beautiful and sleek
They are well contructed
and have high-quality scissor keys.
The battery life is measured in years.
The combination of black gloss plastic
and aluminum give it a very high quality look and feel.
programmable function keys are great.
Unfortunately it has many keys
that don't work.
and it malfunctioned right out of the box.
It lags and is unresponsive at times,
it disconnects from the USB dongle
and needs to be re-setup,
