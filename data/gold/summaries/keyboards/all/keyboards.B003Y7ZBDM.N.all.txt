This keyboard looks very sleek
This is a pretty good keyboard for the price.
The illumination of the keys is perfect.
They're not too bright or too dim.
This keyboard is nice and bright, plug and play and easy to use.
It has a variety of other useful function buttons
including volume buttons for the sound.
Also the location of some of the important keys
are in odd places.
Even the space bar is tiny.
The keyboard also feels flimsy
when typing on it.
This is NOT a " full sized " standard keyboard.
