Good typing feel.
For the price,
this is a good buy,
This keyboard is a very good value.
Keys are quiet
and require minimal pressure.
It's cheap, simple, and smooth.
I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the Microsoft keyboard
but my spacebar would get stuck all the time.
A cheaply-made, flimsy keyboard.
The home, end, insert, etc. keys are awkwardly placed.
