that feels like it will last for years.
It's an plain-looking, solidly-built thing,
Pros : Not very expensive, supposedly spill proof, good 104 key layout.
Usable with both USB and PS2 ports.
Decent appearance.
it's not oversize
is too small,
Usual mushy feel of a `` chicklet ''
(membrane) keyboard.
can become frustrating.
The backspace key is really small,
and the insert/delete / home/end
/ etc. cluster is one row lower than usual.
