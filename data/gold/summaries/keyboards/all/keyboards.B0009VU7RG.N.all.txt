Pros : works
as it should right out of the box.
(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)
are handy.
I like the finger feeling, quiet and soft.
This is a very nice keyboard for the price.
Not the highest quality keyboard, but good in features,
large sized keys, easy to type with responsive smooth keys to the touch, with a slight dip in each key.
I do not like the key action, the key noise and the cheap feel of the keyboard.
Keyboard arrived with numerous letters popped out of the case.
it's just not comfortable or quiet.
