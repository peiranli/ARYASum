Good typing feel.
Nice pre-programmed buttons for volume, calculator, and MyComputer.
Keys are quiet
feels good, has nice extra features,
The thing was for a serial port
is not worth the fifteen bucks.
Cheap build : the little legs in the back
Do not purchase
Yep its cheap and dinky,
My only problem
was getting used to the new positioning of the Home, Insert, Delete, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys
