I like the size of this keyboard.
It's small and attractive.
Sleek looking,
The price is right.
The keys are smooth
that there is no cut off switch
not auto shut off
so the battery does not last more than one day.
Also, too much lag
that the keys are loose
they kind of wobble
which gives it a cheapish feel,
that the keys are a bit stiff.
so it takes a little
getting used to.
