This keyboard is perfect
Pros : Not very expensive, supposedly spill proof, good 104 key layout.
Usable with both USB and PS2 ports.
and it seems to not only work well
but " feel " well, too.
This is a very affordable keyboard
that will provide you with many hours of dependability...
On a mushy keyboard like this one, you're never sure
if your keystroke has registered,
It simply requires too much effort
to press each key.
The only negative is the size of the backspace key
