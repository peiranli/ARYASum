The top row of number keys all stuck right out of the box.
The Num-lock, 7,4,1, and zero keys stopped working after 1 hour,
and the down arrow quit too, then the spacebar.
and the key layout is very poor.
There's no mute button,
some of the keys are to small.
that the keys are pretty loud
when pressed & it needs a longer cord.
