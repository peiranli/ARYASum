Pros : works
as it should right out of the box.
(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)
are handy.
I like the finger feeling, quiet and soft.
This is a very nice keyboard for the price.
Not the highest quality keyboard, but good in features,
large sized keys, easy to type with responsive smooth keys to the touch, with a slight dip in each key.
