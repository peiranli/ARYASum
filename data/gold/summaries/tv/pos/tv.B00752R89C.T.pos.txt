The form factor is also very good.
I love
how shallow
the profile is,
and the bezel is thin, as well.
I also give it kudos for the energy efficiency.
This size was perfect.
and the sound is ok.
Good picture, easy to set up and program.
The audio is above what i expected from a 24-Inch TV.
I tested it with First-Person Shooters on the Xbox 360
and it was topnotch.
Great Tv for the price.
