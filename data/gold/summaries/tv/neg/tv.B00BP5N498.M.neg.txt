The picture quality was worse than my 5 year old LCD Samsung.
The TV is not true 120hz.
The TV died exactly 2 months after purchase.
Within a year the HDMI ports stopped working
The picture however was very disappointing.
was a loose frame around the LED
Sometimes, after changing TV inputs, the screen goes black after a minute or so.
