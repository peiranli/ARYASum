The sound is mediocre.
When the picture is blank,
the right side of the screen is blue
while the left side is black.
Quit
working after 9 + months.
Also color washes out at greater than 30 degree angle, can still see picture just looks like its in a bright fog.
Has the tinny sound of small speakers.
