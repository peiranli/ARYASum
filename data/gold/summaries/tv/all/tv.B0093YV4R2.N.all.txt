This tv has great picture and sound...
We are very pleased.
and it has all the features and inputs
Setup was very easy and the remote is simple to use.
Sound quality is produced from two 8 watt speakers that sound clear and not muffled.
it's hit
and miss on quality and picture
However, the sound is lacking.
