The color and definition are excellent.
Set up was extremely easy and the remote is simple to use.
It has been nothing but great to me!!!
One of the best tv 's!!!
It's great for casual TV watching.
The sound is TERRIBLE.
The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing
Cable picture is poor.
That problem is with the magnitude of the volume.
