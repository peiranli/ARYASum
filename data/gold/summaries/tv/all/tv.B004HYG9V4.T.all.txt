Plenty of ports and settings
Easy hookups to audio and satellite sources.
The sound is good and strong.
This TV looks very good
and the price is even better.
The on-screen menu/options is quite nice
and the internet apps work as expected.
The picture is clear and sharp.
the wireless connectivity is 802. 11b...
which is TOO SLOW to stream HD video...
The software and apps built into this TV
are difficult to use and setup
Their service is handled off shore making communication a bit difficult. : (
