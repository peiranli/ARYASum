The TV quality is pretty solid for the price
Wonderful television picture, size and quality are all excellent.
The user interface is very user friendly
and everything is easily accessible.
Delivery was excellent and easy.
white spots are
starting to show up all over the TV.
Apparently the backlight going out is a pretty common problem.
Very poor picture.
Very grainy and lousy motion control.
What is disappointing is the viewing angle.
It comes preloaded with netflix
which would be great except for it lacks the processor speed necessary to actually stream anything.
