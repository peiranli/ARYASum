and the features are pretty good.
For the price, I'm happy with this
Clear picture,
Ultra thin and weighs less than 40 pounds.
The swivel stand is an added bonus
Easy to set up, nice slim lines, great picture and sound.
The sound is mediocre.
When the picture is blank,
the right side of the screen is blue
while the left side is black.
Quit
working after 9 + months.
Also color washes out at greater than 30 degree angle, can still see picture just looks like its in a bright fog.
Has the tinny sound of small speakers.
