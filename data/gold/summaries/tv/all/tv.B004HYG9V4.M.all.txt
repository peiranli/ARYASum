Picture quality great,
Plenty of ports and settings
The sound is good and strong.
This TV looks very good
and the price is even better.
The on-screen menu/options is quite nice
and the internet apps work as expected.
iManual are crap,
The replacement unit failed within two months.
Web content is equally bad
Once in a while lately, the tv turns itself off.
