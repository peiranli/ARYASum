TV is nice with big screen, good color, great sound & 3D
It has an excellent picture,
The set has fantastic resolution
and that is excellent.
Sound quality is decent
and it is loud enough
Brightness adjusts automatically.
but there was a huge buzz directly in front of the screen
It really lacks in smartness
