This unit is quite easy to use
and to set up.
This is very affordable for a HDTV.
The pictures is clear,
sharp and the colors are vibrant.
Picture is awesome, zero lag for gaming, plenty of inputs on the back.
It was missing the screw for it's stand
and it had 3 dead pixels.
Also, the sound on this thing is terrible.
The remote doesn't work very well either.
The picture looks very pixelated
and i can see lines across the screen.
