Great price, good picture, easy to install with Netflix.
Has 2 HDMI slots in the back as well as 2 component and 2 A/V and S-Video.

and then cycles on and off with any HD input signal.
BUT - there is a noticeable and irritating `` trace '' effect with the color red.
my only complaint
is the sound,
