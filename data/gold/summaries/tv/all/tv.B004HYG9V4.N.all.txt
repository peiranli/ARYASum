Picture quality great,
Picture is crisp and clear with lots of options
to change for personal preferences.
Plenty of ports and settings
to satisfy most everyone.
The sound is good and strong.
But the numbers of options available in the on-line area of the Tv are numerous and extremely useful!
I am very disappointed with this TV for two reasons : picture brightness and channel menu.
The software and apps built into this TV
are difficult to use and setup
Unit developed a high pitch whine
