This size was perfect.
Good picture, easy to set up and program.
The lighting the screen emits is very vibrant and the colors show up very well.
The audio is above what i expected from a 24-Inch TV.
Great Tv for the price.
Easy to setup.
Set functioned well for a few months
and suddenly was unresponsive to the remote.
Adjusting bass, treble, etc on this is annoying and only moderately helpful.
The picture is not at all crisp
and the audio is TERRIBLE!!!
