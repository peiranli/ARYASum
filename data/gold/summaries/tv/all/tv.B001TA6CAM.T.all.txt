Great price, good picture, easy to install with Netflix.
You have different sound and picture settings for different purposes,
the sound is great
Perfect for any type of gaming, Forza 3, MW2, Mass effect 2.
It gets progressively worse with time.
Not reliable.
There is a slight hum from the TV
the sound did not always keep up.
but there is a bit of vibration
when it's set too loud.
