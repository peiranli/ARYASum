it doubles
as a computer monitor with a built in VGA port.
Picture and sound are both acceptable
Set up was extremely easy and the remote is simple to use.
It is a better computer monitor, in my opinion,
The sound is TERRIBLE.
The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing
They don't even offer support for this TV.
Cable picture is poor.
Don't even bother with the stereo sound
because it drowns out all the voices in movies.
