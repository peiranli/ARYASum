The sound is
surprisingly very good and for general TV viewing
So far, it's a terrific TV.
Great for the price.
Love this TV!
Video is great,
I realized its not the headphones but the audio outputs on the TV
that are not functioning.
The TV died exactly 2 months after purchase.
The picture however was very disappointing.
