easy to use features
This is a very light headset,
Sound quality is fine,
it comes with 3 different size ear-buds
No problem pairing it up
It's comfortable
and can be customized for a secure fit, easy to connect, great battery life, clear communication and most importantly for me,
the volume is GREAT!
Ant the price was very reasonable too.
