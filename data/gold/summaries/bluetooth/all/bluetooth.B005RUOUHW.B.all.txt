The set up was easy, even with various and multiple simultaneous devices.
This headset sounds good, has great options
and is comfortable to wear.
Wind and noise cancellation are beyond incredible!
I receive nothing but complaints from the people I'm talking to about the noise in the background
it is the most uncomfortable and insecure fitting ear piece
The voice quality on the other end of the conversation
I have been told is very poor, and much worse than other headsets.
