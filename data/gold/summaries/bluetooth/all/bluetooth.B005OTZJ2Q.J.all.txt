Great product for the cost.
Very easy to use and compatible with all of my phones!
It holds a charge great, is light enough
and fits perfectly in my ear.
The sound quality is great,
the style is very cool and the unit feels top quality.
it would drop and reconnect every 10 seconds
Nobody could hear me
I couldn't get it to unpair from the phone,
There's apparently no noise-cancellation in these.
The battery life is...
bizarre.
Cheap, plastic-y, and poor sound quality.
