It synced with my phone easily,
and people can hear me very clearly.
It fits great in my ear,
Battery life seems to be very good on it as well.
This product does not keep a charge very long and cuts off continually.
The earpiece is very uncomfortable.
The earpiece for this bluetooth blocks sound out too much.
