Setup was incredibly easy and painless ;
Over all it fits nice, keeps a charge for a long time
and is cheap.
Very durable, clarity and noise cancelling is great.
feels slightly uncomfortable for me
The voice quality is not crystal clear,
The volume level in my ear is low even at the highest setting.
