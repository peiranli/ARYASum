Fantastic sound, great fit and a simple practicle set up.
Strengths : Sweat and water resistant, lighter
- The range is really poor.
The ear buds never fill snug in your ear,
The audio becomes VERY choppy
if the device is not within the `` optimal zone ''
You need to speak very loudly for the mic
to pick up the sound.
