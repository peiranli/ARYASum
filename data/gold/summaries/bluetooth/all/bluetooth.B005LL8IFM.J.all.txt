It is lightweight
and the buttons are quite accessible.
The set sounds good, had great range
and connects easily.
It's also nicely solid feeling.
Good battery life.
But no one ever has a hard time
hearing me.
then I couldn't get it to charge,
A complete waste of money.
The broke on the first usage,
Made of very cheap plastic
and very uncomfortable, in a few minutes
they hurts your ears.
how the sound varies every time
the product can not tolerate ANY moisture
Not very durable.
Sensitive microphone.
