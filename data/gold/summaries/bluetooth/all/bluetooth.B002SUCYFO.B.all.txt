easy to use features
The sound quality is good
and can be customized for a secure fit, easy to connect, great battery life, clear communication and most importantly for me,
the volume is GREAT!
Ant the price was very reasonable too.
The headset randomly turns off at times,
The person on the other side usually has lot of issues with the sound quality.
