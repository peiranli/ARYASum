It connected with my phone easily
the price is great
Lightweight and comfortable fit in the ear.
Very easy to use and compatible with all of my phones!
It holds a charge great, is light enough
The sound quality is great,
the style is very cool and the unit feels top quality.
I couldn't get it to unpair from the phone,
There's apparently no noise-cancellation in these.
Cheap, plastic-y, and poor sound quality.
and the bluetooth has a hard time staying connected.
