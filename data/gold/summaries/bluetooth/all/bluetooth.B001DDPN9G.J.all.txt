Fantastic sound, great fit and a simple practicle set up.
It is portable and sweat proof.
The Jaybird are very comfortable.
They don't move once in place
First, it is not designed well
Second, bluetooth connection works intermitently
- The range is really poor.
The # 1 problem is the cord behind the neck.
You need to speak very loudly for the mic
to pick up the sound.
the charger is large.
it always takes a few minutes just to put it on &
