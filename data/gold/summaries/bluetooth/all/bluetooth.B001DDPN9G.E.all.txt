Fantastic sound, great fit and a simple practicle set up.
It is portable and sweat proof.
First, it is not designed well
causing it to fit poorly around ear.
- The range is really poor.
The # 1 problem is the cord behind the neck.
Also, don't rely on using this for phone use.
the bluetooth cuts out quite often
the charger is large.
