I really liked the color of this bluetooth.
The fit is excellent.
The controls are simple and easy to manipulate
it's cheap,
easy pairing and good clear sound.
The battery is pretty good as well.
The calls from him are clear and not as much background noise
The ear hook doesn't rotate back
and the unit is very hard to put on.
The sound quality is bad
and the noise reduction sucks.
Does not fit well,
The placement of the on/off button is a bit unreachable
