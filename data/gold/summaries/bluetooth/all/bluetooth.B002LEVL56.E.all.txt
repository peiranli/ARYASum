Setup was incredibly easy and painless ;
Cheap price
Over all it fits nice, keeps a charge for a long time
Very durable, clarity and noise cancelling is great.
It has a plain look
volume is great, really nice piece of equipment.
Easy to turn ON and OFF.
It has no on or off button.
The fit for this item is absolutely HORRIBLE for me.
the multifunction is too sensitive.
The voice quality is not crystal clear,
The volume level in my ear is low even at the highest setting.
