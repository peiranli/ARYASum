The fit is excellent.
it's cheap,
It gets the job done.
easy pairing and good clear sound.
and has sufficient volume
and comes with extra ear pieces,
The ear hook doesn't rotate back
and the unit is very hard to put on.
and there are no instructions on how to install them.
The sound quality is bad
and the noise reduction sucks.
so it acts like a cheap headset.
Does not fit well,
picks up a lot of background noise.
but the volume is not that great
However, the ear piece hook broke very easily after about a week wearing.
