It was an inexpensive piece,
I do like the design of it and the fact
It synced with my phone easily,
and it sounds pretty good.
and people can hear me very clearly.
It fits great in my ear,
and it's not uncomfortable.
Battery life seems to be very good on it as well.
This product does not keep a charge very long and cuts off continually.
The earpiece is very uncomfortable.
it was not a good investment.
It's not the best quality product,
The colored lights
flashing different amounts of time
can be confusing,
But nobody could hear me
