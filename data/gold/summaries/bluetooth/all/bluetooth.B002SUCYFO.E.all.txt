easy to use features
but the battery life is good so still merits 3 stars.
This is a very light headset,
Sound quality is fine,
and it was easy to pair it with my phone.
The earpiece is comfortable
Ant the price was very reasonable too.
The charge slot is loose, easily gets disconnected during charging.
Network connection often gets disconnected too.
Shoddy, uncomfortable, crappy sound, won't stay in the ear.
is that the ear-bud is too hard
