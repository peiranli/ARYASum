The appearance of this Bluetooth headset looks fine.
It was an inexpensive piece,
It synced with my phone easily,
I get good sound quality,
It fits great in my ear,
Battery life seems to be very good on it as well.
This product does not keep a charge very long and cuts off continually.
The earpiece is very uncomfortable.
This unit also has a lot of issues with interruption in the conversation.
It's not the best quality product,
But nobody could hear me
