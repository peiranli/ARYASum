The earpiece looks nice
and is easy to turn on and pair.
It also has easy to use voice commands for common things
Volume is great.
Sound quality is good
Great battery saver.
The ear hook is strong yet flexible for a comfortable fit.
Very disappointed in the performance of this headset.
I receive nothing but complaints from the people I'm talking to about the noise in the background
it is the most uncomfortable and insecure fitting ear piece
the volume buttons are not convenient
