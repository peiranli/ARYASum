easy to use features
This is a very light headset,
Sound quality is fine,
it comes with 3 different size ear-buds
No problem pairing it up
It's comfortable
and can be customized for a secure fit, easy to connect, great battery life, clear communication and most importantly for me,
the volume is GREAT!
Ant the price was very reasonable too.
The charge slot is loose, easily gets disconnected during charging.
Network connection often gets disconnected too.
worked only for 3 months
Shoddy, uncomfortable, crappy sound, won't stay in the ear.
is that the ear-bud is too hard
that the power button is very small,
