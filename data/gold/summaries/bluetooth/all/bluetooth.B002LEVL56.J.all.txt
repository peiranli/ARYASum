Setup was incredibly easy and painless ;
Cheap price
they can hear me clearly,
It has a plain look
It easily paired to my phone,
and voice quality was pretty good.
It fits comfortably around the ear,
really crisp sound,
Easy to turn ON and OFF.
It has no on or off button.
You have to hold down the redial button
to turn it off.
The fit for this item is absolutely HORRIBLE for me.
It only comes with one size ear piece,
and it WILL NOT stay in my ear.
the multifunction is too sensitive.
feels slightly uncomfortable for me
