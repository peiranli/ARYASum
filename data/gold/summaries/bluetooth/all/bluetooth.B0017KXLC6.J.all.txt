The item is well made,
Fits the ear nicely.
Good for general driving usage.
It also fits tighter to your head.
It also has 3 colors
as it is charging.
and comfortable.
The sound quality is good
and am still getting excelent connection results
including volume range and noise.
It has excellent recharge time and charge life.
and it was never comfortable.
It's very heavy
It never did fit properly
It won't always link with the phone.
It doesn't warn me
just shuts off.
This one has a problem with the volume
Sound quality is selective.
