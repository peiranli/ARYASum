I really liked that vertical design of this bag
The Kensington laptop case has good protection for a laptop.
The quality is also excellent.
It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.
The price is great
I am very disappointed in the quality of item
The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style.
The only drawback is having to leave it plane-side for small planes.
