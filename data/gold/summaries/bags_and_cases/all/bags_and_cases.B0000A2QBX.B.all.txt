The quality of the bag is outstanding.
The design is perfect to fit the laptop, batteries, pens, paperwork, etc..
The padding inside really keeps the laptop secure.
Nice looking, and well built.
There is NO way this thin! thin! thin! case would protect a pencil let alone a heavy laptop.
but will brake due to poor quality.
