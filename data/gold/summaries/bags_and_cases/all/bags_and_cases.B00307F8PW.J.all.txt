It looks good,
This bag is very padded,
has lots of compartments and space, BUT,
Fits perfectly!
Seems very durable and a good size.
It looks exactly like the picture
Definitely a great value!!!
I love the material on the outside
because it works for a larger laptop.
that the bag will sit upright
The outside pocket is handy,
BUT the smell is really bad.
The " leather " is already peeling,
and the straps are small..
It will fit a lap top.. and that is about it.
it's too HEAVY.
Just looked cheap.
