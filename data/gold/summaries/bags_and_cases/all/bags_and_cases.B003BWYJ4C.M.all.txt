like it protects my laptop well
this stylish bag is well-constructed and just the thing.
Fits very well, especially for the Pro, looks pretty, and very light weight.
and yet provides enough protection during normal use.
It was very small and tight.
The pink flowers look really fake and cheap.
It's poor quality
and I don't trust my laptop
to be protected in it.
One zipper isn't as smooth
