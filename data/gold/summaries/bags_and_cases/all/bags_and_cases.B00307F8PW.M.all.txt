It looks good,
This bag is very padded,
This is a nice big bag, and super cheap,
Seems very durable and a good size.
Has a couple pockets
inside that are convenient
The " leather " is already peeling,
and the straps are small..
it's too HEAVY.
I also didn't like the stitching.
The biggest problem is the straps.
