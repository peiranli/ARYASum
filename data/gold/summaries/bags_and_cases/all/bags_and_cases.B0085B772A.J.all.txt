and looked fine,
Good product design,
The sleeve gives a good protection
This bag is very well-made.
I especially like the front pocket.
The fit is perfect
Overall, a good value.
but poor description.
First, the sleeve is a bit too big for the Macbook Air.
The material is quite thin.
It's light padded
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop
scratching it.
It probably won't protect my laptop from a fall,
My only complaint is the interior color -
