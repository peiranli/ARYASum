The Kensington laptop case has good protection for a laptop.
It has a really comfortable handle
The quality is also excellent.
It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.
I am very disappointed in the quality of item
The plastic handles can not stand up to normal wear
The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style.
