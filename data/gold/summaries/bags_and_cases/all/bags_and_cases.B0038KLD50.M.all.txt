The case looks lovely,
and seems well made.
and the laptop fits perfect there.
It has sufficient pockets and nice padding for the laptop compartment.
and for the price it is a great value.
'd had a defective zipper.
the padding underneath was not very effective in protecting my laptop.
they're not very durable.
