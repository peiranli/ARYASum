This case looks and feels great,
Top cover fit perfect.
and has effectively protected my macbook.
The case did not line up with the ports
The styrofoam feet are going to fall off instantly.
but is not too good for protection.
The keyboard cover was great but after having it a few months
the cover is not sealing anymore.
