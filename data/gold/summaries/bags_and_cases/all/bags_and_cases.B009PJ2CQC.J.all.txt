I do like the soft material inside,
Very nice leather and quality product
Also great protection with average use.
and looks great.
Right size.
Great price.
The case is so small
and it doesn't even begin to fit.
and the seams began to tear within a week of receiving it.
It's not leather,
Although it pops open regularly,
IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.
The quality isn't the best
