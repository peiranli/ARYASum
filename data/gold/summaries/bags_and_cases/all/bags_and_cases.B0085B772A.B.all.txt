Thin but well padded, inexpensive,
and good
looking sleeve.
Overall, great product for a reasonable price.
Steel zipper glides are kept away from scratching your laptop by internal gussets of neoprene.
The fit is perfect
It's light padded
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop
so they might end up
scratching it.
