It has room for power cables and a few other small things.
The padding is good
I love the styling and details,
and it is a tight fit
and keeps the computer really protected,
The quality of the bag is outstanding.
The price on Amazon is great
Just the right size
Nice looking, and well built.
I don't have any foam included.
and received no communication in return!
but will brake due to poor quality.
It was way too small.
it can only fit a 14 '' screen.
but it's too thin.
Doesn't look shiny and fancy, though,
