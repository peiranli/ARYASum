Thin but well padded, inexpensive,
and good
looking sleeve.
The sleeve gives a good protection
The side pocket adds a nice touch.
The fit is perfect
Second, the sleeve isn't really that protective.
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop
scratching it.
While it's not exactly a " custom fit ",
the black case has a BRIGHT lime green interior.
