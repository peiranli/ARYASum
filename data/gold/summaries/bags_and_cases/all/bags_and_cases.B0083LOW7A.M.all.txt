This bag might look nice,
Has good protection on the inside for the lap top
It is very well built,
The price was good,
It is lightweight.
Love the color.
Poor quality.
Then there was the overpowering chemical smell
Materials are cheap, stitches along the borders are not very secure. barely fit a 14 inch hp sleek notebook.
Does not worth 25 $.
