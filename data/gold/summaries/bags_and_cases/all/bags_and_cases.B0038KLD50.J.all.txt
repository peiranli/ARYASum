The case looks lovely,
and seems well made.
and the laptop fits perfect there.
It's compact, padded everywhere and with a lot of compartments.
The handle is adjustable
and the laptop comes out easily.
It is very durable.
and for the price it is a great value.
it has good form,
Three months later and the strap ripped.
and they never even responded.
'd had a defective zipper.
you can't adjust the strap
so it is simply bad design.
they're not very durable.
As far as internal padding, it's a bit weak for my taste.
