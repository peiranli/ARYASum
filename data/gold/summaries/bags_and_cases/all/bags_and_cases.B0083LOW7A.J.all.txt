Has good protection on the inside for the lap top
It looks great
and overall it functions perfectly!
The color ir so pretty,
It is very well built,
the material has good quality
Also it has cellphone and pens compartments
The price was good,
It is lightweight.
Poor quality.
Then there was the overpowering chemical smell
Materials are cheap, stitches along the borders are not very secure. barely fit a 14 inch hp sleek notebook.
Material is way to cheap
and it won't last to much.
This bag does not fit my laptop.
