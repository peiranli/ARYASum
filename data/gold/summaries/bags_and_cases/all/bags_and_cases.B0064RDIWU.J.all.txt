Color is awesome!
Top cover fit perfect.
and has effectively protected my macbook.
It feels nice and rubbery
It's a perfect fit
It clips on easily,
it has a nice satin outer and hard inner side.
The apple lite shows through
and was in excellent condition.
the fit was not.
and it did not clip into place --
The bottom has no way
of staying on.
but is not too good for protection.
developed cracks all over
and part of it chipped off.
the cover is not sealing anymore.
