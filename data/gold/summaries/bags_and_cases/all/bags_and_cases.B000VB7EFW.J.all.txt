This is a very well made bag, nice construction, lots of pockets.
The quality is excellent
and it is very durable.
the straps are very comfortable.
and protects everything inside.
The color is a true red
and it fits nicely.
it is ripping out already.
and it doesnt fit.
It's just not the lightest backpack
because some zipper teeth were not aligned.
