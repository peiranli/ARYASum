B000BNRWFW-0000
Advertised as leather,	4
but is in fact a cloth backed synthetic!	4
Maybe it's a DM knock off.	5
It is a cheap, but not inexpensive boot.	6
I returned my pair due to the misleading representation.	5
I never put	5
them on and only listed " fit as expected "	1
because it was obligatory to write the review.	5
Beware!	5

B000BNRWFW-0003
These things	5
while they look the same, are not.	5
The leather is a less finished product, a cheaper leather	4
that is not soft at all.	4
All in all, not near	5
what they were back	5
when they were made in England.	5
Made in China... sums it up.	5

B000BNRWFW-0007
The other reviews were right	5
-- Docs are not as comfortable	1
as they were back	1
when I wore them in high school.	5
The leather looks cheaper,	4
and it's taking longer	1
to break them in.	1

B000BNRWFW-0010
They look great, seem to be well made, however,	3 2
is a little tight across the top of foot	1
where the tongue is sewn to the top of boot.	1
It is painful at the moment,	1
but will power through in hopes	5
of breaking them in and thus be able to enjoy for a long time.	1 2

B000BNRWFW-0015
These steel toe boots are great.	5
Need them for work.	5
They are very comfortable	1
and provide the protection	2
I need.	5
Will buy same thing	5
again when and if these wear out.	2

B000GAUOHS-0001
I had such high hopes for these boots	5
after reading all the great reviews.	5
I am an average sized gal	5
and have never had a problem	5
zipping up boots,	5
but these were way too narrow in the foot and the shaft.	1
I wear a size 8 or 8. 5 normally.	7
I ordered the 8	7
and couldn't zip them up even half way,	7
plus the actual foot part was too narrow.	1
I don't think going up half a size	7
would have fixed the narrow width or the the narrow shaft,	5
so I just returned them for a refund.	5

B000GAUOHS-0005
I was really hoping	5
these boots would be cute,	3
based on some other reviewers.	5
But	5
when I got them	5
and tried them on,	5
I was surprised	5
that they were loose around my calves -	1
usually boots are tight on me in that area.	5
Not only that, but the ankle area was really flimsy,	5
and collapsed in an unattractive way.	3
Had to return them.	5

B000GAUOHS-0013
I ordered these boots	5
and immediately sent them back.	5
Too big and baggy on my skinny calves.	7
Ironically enough I bought	5
these boots cause	5
I found a website	5
that specifically recommended them for `` skinny calves ''.	5
I wore them around the house for a while.	5
They seems comfy	1
but were clearly very cheaply made.	2
My quest for skinny calf boots continues...	5
bummer.	5

B000GAUOHS-0033
These are very comfortable & attractive boots for my office environment.	1 3
I bought them before a trip to Chicago & found them to be very dry,	8
but that they would not protect my feet from the cold enough for long walks.	8
The aerosoles sole is just like on their shoes -	4
which is fairly thin.	4
The uppers fit my calf well	5
(in recent years	5
most boot uppers have been too wide for my leg).	5
I only wish	4
that they were leather.	4
Another positive was the lack of break-in time.	1
Wore them 10 hours on the first day.	5

B000GAUOHS-0071
I really love these boots.	5
They fit perfectly	1
and they are VERY comfortable.	1
I can wear them all day at work	1
and my feet do not hurt at all.	1
I am so glad	5
that I found these!	5

B000ZHDMFS-0000
This shoe hurts.	1
As soon as I put it on, I knew	5
it was a mistake	5
to buy them.	5
Where the seams are sewn along all those straps	5
crisscrossing the toes	5
it is quite irritating.	5
I knew	5
I would have blisters within minutes	1
of walking around in them.	1
I tried to take precautions	5
by applying band-aids	5
before I went for a walk,	5
but they were still causing me pain.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0003
I love the design, the material, and the color.	0 4 3
BUT for that price I was expecting SUPER COMFY summer shoes.	1
This is not the case,	5
the inside lining is awful and hurt my feet,	1 4
If I could return them I would.	5
I wore them just once : (	5

B000ZHDMFS-0007
I saw these in a magazine	5
and thought	5
they would be great for a cruise	5
we are	5
taking this summer.	5
I have kind of narrow feet	5
and the shoe is a little tight, width wise.	7
I like the sole	4
and they are comfortable to wear around the house but not for actually walking.	1
They are pretty heavy too.	5
I have a blister after a quick two mile walk	1
(with socks)	5
but am going to continue to try and break them in.	5
I like the toe lift	5
(less tripping)	5
and they should be cooler than my Nikes.	5
They aren't as cute on my size 10 foot as the picture.	3
They used more calf muscle than my other shoes	5
if that matters to anyone.	5

B000ZHDMFS-0011
I really love the design of this shoe and the 360 degrees venting concept.	3
Definitely agree	5
that you need to order a half size down maybe even a full size.	7
If your foot is narrow,	1 7
I don't recommend this shoe	1
as it fits quite wide.	1
I may have to return it because of that.	5
Very cute shoe though!	3

B000ZHDMFS-0018
I finally found the shoe	5
that has toe coverage, yet airy, comfortable and cute.	1 3
I saw these shoes on a ad in the travel magazine	5
and I purchased the same color.	0
The foot bed has memory foam,	4
and there is no break in time necessary.	1
Love these shoes.	5

B001RIYTK6-0001
Great fit, however my socks were soaked the first time	8 1
I wore them out in the rain.	8
I was really upset	5
because they were suppose to keep my feet dry!	8
I returned them as a defective item back to Amazon.	8

B001RIYTK6-0005
These run small	7
and	5
if you have bigger calves	7
they won't fit	7
(you can't tuck your pants in).	7
They were a little thinner in material than the true barn boots	4 2
I am use to,	4 2
so don't buy	2
if you will be needing to use for heavy work.	2

B001RIYTK6-0007
Definitely order a size bigger than your foot	7
as I followed the advice on the other buyers here.	7
It has pretty good traction for a rainy day	8
and interestingly enough I didn't slip that much on ice with these things on.	8
HOWEVER, these aren't worth the price for these shoes.	6
After maybe two months the rubber actually starting	2
tearing at the side of the soles from the constant folding the rubber had gone through in my numerous walks.	2
Also, the buckles at the top are pretty much there for decoration	4 2
and sometimes would come out of the buckles	4 2
to hang quite unattractively on the side.	4 3
If you 're	5
looking for rainboots,	5
definitely go for better ones than these.	5

B001RIYTK6-0010
I love my red boots.	0
They are very sturdy	2
and keep the rain out.	8
They look good	3
and will last a long time	2
(long after red rubber boots go out of style, I'm sure).	2
My one complaint is	5
that they kind of smell	5
when I wear then indoors.	5
But this is obviously	5
because it's a rubber boot	4
and I shouldn't be wearing them for fashion indoors anyway.	4

B001RIYTK6-0016
What a great pair of boots,	5
not only are they cute but super comfortable and very durable.	1 3 2
I spent the night with our cub scout den on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, lots of puddles and rain	8
most of one day my feet never hurt and never got wet...	8
and I looked cute!	3

B004D3CFYE-0000
I purchased these hiking boots specifically	8
because they claimed to be waterproof.	8
The boot even has a little tag on the side	5
indicating so.	5
Apparently Merrell is very proud of it.	5
Long story short, they are anything but waterproof.	8
Even water-resistant would be too generous.	8
As my husband aptly put it,	5
porous is the term	8 4
that best describes the material.	4
Walking through dewy grass for more than a couple of minutes will leave your feet soaking wet.	8
The seams let water penetrate immediately,	8 4
which I found out	5
after walking through a shallow puddle.	5
The boot does not perform any better	8
at repelling water than my sandals.	8
It is that bad.	5
A complete waste of money	5
if you purchase these with the intention	5
of keeping your feet dry.	8

B004D3CFYE-0004
I'm not crazy about these boots.	5
They are very uncomfortable in the foot bed.	1
I can't imagine wearing these shoes to go hiking in.	1
My feet would be killing me.	1
Sorry to say,	5
they went back.	5

B004D3CFYE-0009
I have worn Merrell hiking boots for maybe 20 years.	5
This would be my fourth of fifth pair.	5
Although they are somewhat comfortable to wear for walking,	1
my feet hurt after short level ground hikes.	1
They rubbed on both sides of the toe area where my feet are wide	1
(and	5
why I buy Merrell boots).	5
I did not break them in and that could be a factor.	5
They are light weight and look good, but I am disappointed in the discomfort.	1 3 4

B004D3CFYE-0015
I bought these shoes just before a trip to Niagara Falls	5
and had them shipped overnight.	5
Thank goodness	5
I read the suggestions by other reviewers	5
to order 1/2 size up bacause	7
these shoes definately run small.	1 7
I ordered a 9,	7
usually wear an 8?1/2,	7
and I could possibly have ordered a 9?1/2	7
because my toe is at the end of the shoe	1
(but not cramped enough for me	1
to be unable to wear them).	1
That	5
being said,	5
these shoes really are comfortable with no break in time required.	1
I took them straight out of the box	5
and wore them to walk all around Niagara Falls	1
without any discomfort.	1
And they are waterproof!!	8
I tested it by wearing them on the Maid of the Mist boat ride to the bottom of the falls.	5
I got soaked	8
but my feet stayed dry!!	8
I would definately recommend these shoes to anyone	5
and I 'm	5
considering getting another pair for myself!	5

B004D3CFYE-0036
These boots are awesome!	5
They are perfect for being on your feet all day	1
and are amazingly waterproof.	8
My feet NEVER get wet even when the outside of the boots are soaked.	8
I bought supports with them	5
initially because I have high arches	5
but I didn't even end up	5
needing them,	5
they provided adequate support themselves.	1
Definitely worth the money.	6

B004LLSV5U-0000
I was happy	5
when I purchased them,	5
but the first I stepped into a puddle [	8
not even deep enough	8
to cover all the boot] water ran into my foot.	8
Then I tried them in the snow	8
and my feet got really wet and cold.	8
I wish	5
I could return them now.	5

B004LLSV5U-0003
While they are very cute	3
(I love the color)	0
it's extremely hard	1
to get them on and off.	1
You have to unlace so much of the boot	5
to get into it...	5
and then of course, you have to lace it back up.	5
It takes too much time.	5
I wish	5
I would have bought a zip up.	5

B004LLSV5U-0006
These boots are unbelievably gorgeous and blue is my favorite color.	0
I just wish	5
the heel piece wasn't so hard ;	4
it rubs the backs of my ankles raw	1
and I can not wear them but for so long.	1
They do have good ankle support however	1
which is important in icy conditions.	5
A good pair of boot socks or a shoe horn might be able to fix the ankle rubbing issue.	5
The boots are waterproof and fully lined ; very warm!	8

B004LLSV5U-0010
These fit well	1
and they are comfortable.	1
I would recomend them for the all the snow	8
we have been	5
having in NY.	5
They only issue	5
I have it	5
that I didn't realize what a pain	5
it would be to lace them up.	5

B004LLSV5U-0033
I am very excited to wear these books this winter.	5
They arrived quickly and without issues with the seller or the product.	5
They appear to be very well made	4 2
and are comfortable to wear around.	1
As someone	5
who loves slip on/no fuss shoes,	5
these are a little more time intensive to unlace/relace	5
(loosen)	5
to put on but they are snug	1
and I know	5
will keep my feet and legs dry and warm during the winter/snow/rain.	8

B004SAS28K-0009
For the amount of money I paid	6
one would expect to be able to at least put them on!	6 1
Fitflop has such great soles for the footwear	5
but these are so awkward to try to put on,	1
it requires a shoe horn	1
and bruises the top of the foot!	1
As I discarded the packing materials I am	5
keeping them	5
but will snip the stitching to at least be able to wear them.	1
Very disappointed.	5

B004SAS28K-0014
They were comfortable	1
once I finally got my foot in them,	1
but putting them on with socks was a task.	1
I had to have help	5
I guess	5
my foot was too wide from the bottom to the top of my ankle joint. they would have been perfect	1 7
if they had elastic or zipper on the side	4 1
to help with the foot going into the boot.	1

B004SAS28K-0030
Sadly, I have printed off a return label	5
to send these back.	5
They came in,	5
they looked great, and they I tried to put them on...	3
With all those	5
saying how hard they were to get on,	5
I thought "	5
it shouldn't be a problem	5
". Wrong.	5
I couldn't even get them on to see how they looked	1
or fit	1
once my foot was in them!	1
They looked great,	3
I was excited for them,	5
but	5
if you can't get your foot it,	1
it's a waste.	1
I can't give them a 1	5
because they looked nice	3
and would surely have been comfortable,	1
but i couldn't get them on	1
and had to return them so no 5 either.	5

B004SAS28K-0060
They are cozy warm and comfortable	1
just like the Fit Flops I wear all summer long.	1
The only problem	5
I have had with these	5
is trying to slide them	1
on when wearing socks.	1
There is friction with the suede inside	1 4
so they don't go on easily.	1 4
I need a shoe horn.	5
They are easy to slide off	1
but putting them on is difficult.	1
Still worth it though	5
once they are on.	5
They look great	3
and feel great.	1

B004SAS28K-0085
I needed to replace my much loved Uggs.	5
I wanted extreme comfort & extreme ease	1
of wearing.	1
These boots have both.	1
The only thing	4
that could improve them	4
would be fleece inside.	4
I do kind of miss that.	5
True to size, soft suede especially on ankle area, superb FitFlop comfort	1 4 7
(I have been a Fit Flop Fan for many years now)	5
and casual,	3
go with everything looks make this	3
a great find.	3
I ususally don't shoe shop online,	5
but	5
since Amazon offered free returns,	5
I thought "	5
what the heck ".	5
I have returned about 80 % of the shoes	5
I ordered,	5
but FitFlops always fit first time!	1
You won't be disappointed!	5

B004UER758-0001
I hate these.	5
They do not fit well, are horribly uncomfortable	1
and make a squeaky noise no matter what type of floor you are walking on.	1
I used to be a big fan of MInnetonka	5
but I guess	5
it's not the 70	5
's anymore.	5
You would think	1
they would consider comfort	1
but I guess	1 3
they are only going for cute..	3

B004UER758-0005
These were very narrow.	1 7
Will have to return them.	5
Was sad	5
that my 10 year old granddaughter's Christmas gift was a bust.	5
Such a beautiful moccasin but a shame they didn't seem true to size.	3 7

B004UER758-0014
I ordered these in a 7?1/2	7
which I usually wear	7
but sent them back because too big.	7
A 7 was sent to me	7
but they are still too big,	7
I sould	7
have ordered a whole size down	7
but I didn't want to send back and wait more time to get them AGAIN!	5
They are awesome looking	3
and I do love them.	3
The ankle is a little too large	1 7
but that 's	5
because I'm petite.	5
I'd recommend these any day	5
but just be aware of the sizing.	7

B004UER758-0042
Love the style and taupe color is perfect.	0 3
They are a comfortable fit on width, but a little long in length.	1 7
Normally a 9 fits perfect,	7
but this is a tab long.	7
I've worn them	5
and it's not an issue.	5
Well made and just something different to wear.	2

B004UER758-0078
These boots are really cute and great quality.	3
I love wearing them with skinny jeans or with tights and a dress.	5
I am usually a size 6 and so I ordered a size 6.	7
They are too big even with heavy socks,	7
so I'd say size down a half or maybe even full size.	7
I decided to keep mine	7
even though they are too big though -	7
the sizing issue doesn't give me any problems	1 7
since they are flats,	1
and being booties are secure around the ankle.	1
When I got them,	5
the fringe was all crazy and going in every which direction,	4 3
but I just smoothed down the fringe,	4 3
laid the boots on their side	3
and rested some heavy books on top of them for a few days.	3
After that, they looked better, and then	3
the fringe also just naturally calmed down with time.	4 3
Great buy - love Minnetonka!	5

B008BG2IM8-0000
I ordered these shoes in a wide size,	7
but found	5
that after only about an hour my toes were completely numb.	1
Normally ordering my size in a wide works very well,	7
but not with this shoe.	7
It is painful!	1
I actually wound up wearing my sneakers for the rest of the day at work.	5
Not good!	5
With that said,	5
I have these remaining things to share about this shoe :	5
First, I recommend not ordering these	5
if you have wide feet -	5
they are NOT wide.	5
Second,	5
they seem	5
like they fit a little `` short '' ;	1
if you have narrow feet	5
and still want to try them,	5
I recommend you try 1/2 size up.	7
Third, the shoes seem	2
well made	2
and appear to be decent quality.	2
However, that was not enough	5
to make up for my suffering.	5
I do not recommend this shoe or this brand,	5
to be honest.	5
Get on the ball Naturalizer ;	5
I expected more from you!	5

B008BG2IM8-0002
The reviews had said a little narrow.	7
Because I am not a big person,	5
I thought	5
that would work for me.	5
After wearing them for 20 minutes,	1
I could not wear them another second longer.	1
They killed my feet!	1
I won't bother trying to find the right fit at this point,	5
I will go with other brands	5
I know better.	5
I loved the look and color	0 3
so I am disappointed	5
they didn't fit properly.	1

B008BG2IM8-0004
I absolutely love the style	3
and wish they fit right.	1
At first I thought	5
they were just a little snug	1
and they didnt ' hurt.	1
Once the weather got cold the shoes became more stiff and they really hurt now	1
so it looks like I wasted $ 40.	5

B008BG2IM8-0010
These shoes are very comfortable and cute.	1 3
However, I would order one size larger than normal.	7
I usually wear	5
a B width and these are very narrow.	7
You'll get blisters	1
if you don't wear socks with them	1
because they're so narrow.	1 7
I ordered a half size larger	7
and they were still a little tight.	1 7
They're very good quality.	4 2

B008BG2IM8-0015
I am actually wearing these shoes today.	5
They are much more comfortable than some of my other heels of similar design and height.	1
The insoles are quite cushioned	1
and they look and feel great.	1 3
Love them!	5

B00EFD6B8I-0000
At first I loved	5
them!!	5
Wore them all the time.	5
Then one night about 3 weeks	5
after I got them the heel collapsed.	2
My friend looked at the heel	5
and it was a hollow heel.	4
No support in the heel.	4 2
Very disappointed in my purchase.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0003
These boots are adorable	3
and they fit perfectly.	1
I usually wear a 9?1/2	7
and ordered a 10	7
since there wasn't an option for the half size.	7
They fit great	1 7
and are pretty comfortable too.	1
However, I've worn them out three times and don't think	2
I will ever wear them again.	2
The heel is made of cheep rubber and deflates	4 2
when I walk.	5
So if i'm walking on my tip-toes	5
and don't put pressure on my heels	5
they're okay	5
but if I walk normally at all,	5
they deflate and make an annoying squish sound.	5
Very disappointed in the quality of these.	2

B00EFD6B8I-0008
I was excited to receive these boots.	5
The color was exactly	0
was	0
I was looking for.	0
They are a little shorter	7
than I thought	5
they'd be.	5
Also the left one is much bigger than the right.	7
I have never had a problem like this with shoes,	5
not ever.	5
I was a little disappointed.	5
I still wear them just not as often.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0015
These boots are exactly as pictured.	3
They are very light weight & fairly comfortable.	1
Obviously, these boots aren't made to wear daily, but more so	2
to wear with that " perfect outfit " here & there.	5
The boots are grey,	3
which I was pleasantly surprised because other boots	5
I 've	5
tried to get	5
that coloring will show up charcoal or silver.	5
The color & style is wonderful!	0 3
I do love them!	5

B00EFD6B8I-0025
I love	5
these boots,	5
if you are looking for cowgirl boots	5
that wont cost an arm and a leg,	6
look no farther!	5
I have a couple different pairs of these,	5
and they go with anything!	3
I wear them with jeans and dresses!	5
Very comfy and stylish.	1 3
Size it true to fit also!	7
I wear between a 7 and a half and an 8.	7
I ordered a size 8 just in case	7
and they fit perfect!	1 7
