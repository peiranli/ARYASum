Yes they have a steal toe	4
but they have a tag on them	5
that reads `` IMPORTANT WARNINGTheae shoes	5
(boots) have	5
been designed and manufactured as, and, for use as FASHION FOOTWEAR ONLY.	4
They are not for use as safety footwear,	4
and should not under any circumstances be worn as safety footwear... `` A warning is also stitched into the inside of the boot near the heal	4
that reads `` NON-SAFTY FOOTEAR `` I am a little	5
let down that this fact is not listed in the products description.	5
The reason I purchased these boots for work	5
and they do not meet the required safety standard.	5

B000BNRWFW-0005
I got	5
black ankle high boots like I wore back in the 90 's..	5
These don't come close to the quality	4
they had	5
when they were made in UK..	5
Just like everything else, cheaply made shoe from China.	5
Leather is very thin & sole	4
is super soft unlike the way they were made.	4
They are okay boots but very sad to see quality going into the crapper along with everything	5
now made in China..	5
I'd pay $ 200. 00 for quality boots vs. $ 125. 00 for junk..	6

B000BNRWFW-0008
so I order this shoe is such high hopes,	5
shipping was fast so thats a plus.	5
Now my issue	4
with this boots were	4
that they came	4
without any type of cushioning???	4
I didn't cared much but	5
after I tried them on i	5
heard a horrible squeak	5
coming out of them.	5
I concluded	5
that the tongue was the issue. anyways	4
i returned them for a pair of DR Martens Saltaire	5
ST boots.	5
This was 2 years ago so	5
hopefully this classic boots changed that.	5

B000BNRWFW-0013
I purchased the black steel toe boots.	5
When they arrived,	5
the little piece inside the shoe	5
that goes at the heel	5
had fallen off.	2
There was some dried glue	4
where it was supposed to have been.	5
I just stuck it back but seriously?	5
I was sort of disappointed	5
but other than	5
that the boots were in good condition.	5
They are comfortable	1
after breaking them in!	1

B000BNRWFW-0019
Got these bad boys for Christmas.	5
Took awhile to break them in	5
but am so glad	5
I did.	5
Very comfortable,	1
and I also feel tough with the steel toe.	5
Good for the snow too.	8
Would recommend for anyone	5
who wants traditional and sturdy Dr. Martens.	2

B000GAUOHS-0002
I guess	5
I thought the name " lasticity " and the description of the stretch of this boot,	5
led me to believe	5
that it would fit a wider calf.	1
I could not even zip this boot up	1
and it did not have much stretch to it at all!	1
I have about a 17 " calf so for those of you	5
ladies with larger calf sizes...	5
this boot is not for you!	5
It also appears to be a taller boot,	3
but I would say	3
it is barely mid-calf.	3
Otherwise, it is a nice looking boot for the price.	6 3
Disappointed!	5

B000GAUOHS-0007
I learned the hard way	5
that the brand name " Aerosoles " does not always mean comfort.	1
I loved the style	3
and tried to use shoe stretch spray	5
and wear multiple socks	5
to loosen the grip of the shoe around the width of my feet for a week or so to no avail.	1
Also, the sole of the boot was very rigid and unforgiving to the the arches of my feet, thus major uncomfort	1 4
pursued my body.	1

B000GAUOHS-0019
These boots have a sturdy, comfortable sole with a heel	1
that is easy to walk on	1
and ample toe room,	7
but beyond that, I am disappointed.	5
The material is very thin and flimsy	4
(don't expect the shaft	5
to hold up	5
like it does in the picture	5
-- it sagged and wrinkled on my thin calves,	5
leaving a huge gap between the shaft and my leg).	5
In short,	5
if you 're	5
looking for comfort, affordability,	6 1
and have the calves	5
to fill these out,	5
they are a reasonably attractive boot.	3
But don't expect anything beyond that.	5
Given the thin quality of the material,	4
I doubt	2
these boots would last long.	2

B000GAUOHS-0041
I really love the boots mainly	5
because the bottom of the boots have traction for bad weather	8
which is one of the things	5
I was looking for.	5
They also fit my small calves,	1
I have a little room	5
but that is okay.	5
And they have a little shine	3
that is natural	3
and I like that.	5
They are really comfortable	1
and I can wear them to work and not have to take them off all day.	1
I have worn them a lot since I purchased them because of the weather here in D.C.	8
(cold/snow/wet).	8
They are one of my best purchases.	5
Thank you.	5

B000GAUOHS-0076
I bought these boots	5
to wear to my job as a high school teacher.	5
I read many reviews	5
touting the comfort of these boots	1
and they were not lying.	1
I have worn them all day -	1
I mean from 7 AM until 9PM -	5
and my feet do not hurt at all.	1
The soles are not hard either,	4
which helps in the Maine winter.	8
They do not slide easily as many soles tend to do on snow.	8
I would buy these boots again.	5
They fit snuggly around the heel and leg,	1
but not too much so.	1
Just enough to stay up,	5
I think.	5
Some reviews indicated	5
they were a bit tight ;	5
however, I have no issues.	5
I am not overweight,	5
but have athletic calves.	5
They fit me fine.	1
Great boots for the money!	6

B000ZHDMFS-0002
They look great,	3
but are very uncomfortable.	1
While generally bigger overall,	5
the area around the ball of the foot is not comfortable.	1
Also, there are pieces	5
inside that are very scratchy and make them not wearable.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0004
I have several pairs of Jambu shoes	5
and love them.	5
I've always worn my normal size	7
(7).	5
I think	5
the low sides in this shoe is what make it too big.	7
It is way too sloppy for my foot.	1 7
Also the red is not a bright red, but more of a rust.	0
Could be a cute shoe,	3
but not for me.	5
Exchanging for a different style.	5

B000ZHDMFS-0010
Very cute shoes, though they seem to run a bit wide.	3 7
I don't know	5
if they need	5
broken in	5
or what but they gave me a blister on my heel and the start of a blister above my big toe...	1
and I only had them on for an hour just to run to the store	5
and come home.	5
They seem to be well made they just fit kinda funny.	1 2

B000ZHDMFS-0012
I really like this shoe.	5
It is to wide for my feet,	5
but because their a mary jane I can still make them work.	5
I wore them	5
the other dayand	5
they were very comfortable.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0024
saw these advertised in a magazine.	5
Was looking for a good comfortable pair of walking shoes.	1
These are perfect.	5
Fit as expected, true to size and extremely comfortable.	1 7
Nice looking shoes.	3

B001RIYTK6-0003
These boots look good and fit great,	1 3
they have a nice thick sole with good tread.	4
I thought	5
I had finally found the perfect pair of boots.	5
Then the second time	8
I wore them both feet	8
leaked.	8
What's the point of rainboots	8
that don't keep your feet dry??	8
BIG waste of money.	6
Next time I'm going to LL Bean.	5

B001RIYTK6-0006
So, I bought these shoes	5
and they were fine.	5
Hardly wore them,	5
but it's been two years	5
and I had to go back to my reliable LL Beane duck boots	5
because these Chooka's split	2
after sitting in a humidified room for two years.	8 2
Buyer beware.	5
I buy my shoes to last.	5

B001RIYTK6-0009
This boots appeared great but too small.	7
I have always been a 8	7
but even with a very thin sock they were really tight.	7
Plus the insole was oversized	4
and would have to be trimmed.	4
I am disappointed	5
because they looked and felt like great boots.	3
Great price too	6
but BE AWARE.	5
The seller accepted a return	6
but I had to pay the shipping.	6
That cost a third of the price of the boot.	6
Also boots	5
sent in oversized mailing envelope	5
(which is destroyed	5
when opening),	5
would have been nice	5
if they had packed one in for a return.	5
I had to hunt for a box	5
to return in.	5
I would not deal with this seller again.	5

B001RIYTK6-0013
I love the color and craftsmanship of this boot,	0 3
however it runs about a half size small.	7
I bought boot socks	5
to wear this	5
and there is no way	5
to fit them in and my feet too.	7
However my roommate	5
who is a half to full size smaller	7
says	5
it fits great for her.	1
So definitely order up!	5

B001RIYTK6-0018
Although some other reviews scared me	5
before buying this product,	5
I am very pleased with my new rain boots.	5
They fit very comfortably, even with thicker socks.	1
I really like the buckle	4 3
and think	3
it gives the boots some cute flair.	3
I definitely recommend this product to anyone	5
who wants to have high-quality rain boots	2
without paying an absurd about of money.	6

B004D3CFYE-0001
I bought these shoes from Comet shoes on amazon.com	5
and wore it 2 times	2
before the seam came apart from the sole.	2
All this after just 2 regular wears...	2
not even a strenuous hike!	5
I suspect	5
Comet shoes is are selling counterfeit products	5
because Merrell shoes are more reliable.	5
I would not be surprised	5
if other sellers are	5
following a similar practice.	5
I filed	5
a complain about this was told there's nothing	5
you can do	5
to help	5
because it's been 90 days since my purchase.	5
It's shameful	5
that they only look at the date of sale and not the usage	5
before making a refund decision.	5

B004D3CFYE-0007
These are extremely comfortable boots,	1
I did order a half size larger,	7
I love them ;	5
however, I bought them in February	5
and by April the inside fabric of the heel area of my right boot is torn	2
and falling apart.	2
Obviously, a poorly made shoe or inferior materials.	4 2

B004D3CFYE-0010
I liked these shoes for the fit and comfort.	1
They were waterproof at first,	8
but after wearing them for a few months they became quite leaky.	8 2
So	5
if you need something waterproof you	8
should probably look elsewhere.	5

B004D3CFYE-0019
I have hard to fit feet	5
since I need orthotics.	5
These are a little smaller	1 7
than I'd like,	1
but generally ok.	1
I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support	1
without rubbing.	1
Mainly I need walking shoes	5
that are waterproof	8
and so far	5
they 've	5
been ok,	8
walking through wet grass,	8
although haven't had a chance	5
to try them in rain	8
(keeps raining at night!).	5
The color is nice, more light blue than purple.	0

B004D3CFYE-0041
I've tried the shoes in stores	5
but neither had the size	5
I needed.	5
I was super delighted to discover	5
Amazon was selling a third color	0
(grey/blue) at the same price.	0 6
So with prime membership and tax-free, it was a done deal!	5
Also, you will need to buy a 0. 5 size bigger	7
if you want to have a little bit of room after hiking for hours.	1 7
Otherwise, the size	7
that you would normally wear	7
would be quite snug.	7
The shoes also needed to be broken into,	1
but I survived my first hike this past weekend with very minor blisters.	1
It's very sturdy and helped steady my ankles	1 2
(I rolled them a lot	5
when I just wore running shoes).	5
Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,	8
that protects your feet	2
and keep them warm.	5
Thanks!	5

B004LLSV5U-0001
The boots in person don't have the same look as in the picture.	3
They are big shaft shoes!!	3
They are	4
made by two layers of thick fabric.	4
So if you want a pair of casual, very casual, boots	5
what is very very warm,	5
they may be	5
what you want.	5
It's because the way	5
it's constructed,	5
the shafts are narrow and very very hard to put on.	1 2
I tried to adjust with the shoe laces.	5
It ended up not able to maintain the look.	3

B004LLSV5U-0004
I think	5
it should be told how small these boots are running	7
:) they are wonderful contructed boots but very small.	7 2
I have to get two size larger	7
to wear with a pair of socks!	7
not good	5

B004LLSV5U-0008
What I love about this boot is	5
how tall it is.	5
I live in the mountains in Colorado	5
and the snow gets deep	5
so I needed something tall.	5
Great color and good warmth.	0
What I do not like is	5
they are very difficult to slip on and take off.	1
It's like the jaws of life.	5
I tried them	5
without socks	5
and they slip on a little easier.	1
I will keep them in hoping	5
that they'll loosen up some.	5
Untying them doesn't help/work	5
as that is just part of the boots looks.	3
Maybe other buyers will have better luck.	5

B004LLSV5U-0018
Ordered these	5
because they were very much on sale	5
and would get here FAST!	5
We have snow pretty regularly	5
where I live,	5
and I like to have a range of snow boots to keep it interesting.	5
I am very impressed with the warmth of this boot.	8
Of course it takes a little time to lace up,	5
but it's not bad.	5
You 've	5
got to be prepared for cold, wet snow,	5
so why not spend a little time?	5
I'm usually a 7 but the 6. 5 fit fine.	7
These have a fairly good sole, good support, and of course great warmth, especially for synthetic insulating materials.	1 4
I'd give them 5 stars	5
if Timberland made them in the USA.	5

B004LLSV5U-0034
Wow!!!	5
This boots are so beautiful and comfortable.	1 3
I was so impressed how well are made.	2
The price was perfect for me.	6
I totally recommend the boots to anyone	5
who's looking for a great deal.	6

B004SAS28K-0010
The size was right	7
but I couldn't get my foot	1 7
in because there was no easement like a zipper or elastic.	1 4
I was very disappointed	5
as I love	5
Fit Flop sandals and loved the style.	3
I had to return them.	5
I feel	5
you need to design these with a zipper.	4

B004SAS28K-0021
This boot has nothing to unzip or anything flexible to make it possible to get the boot on your foot.	1 4
Ridiculous design.	5
The buckle is only for looks,	4 3
and you would assume	4
the inner ankle has an elastic insert.	4
You would be wrong.	4
You have to literally shove and push your foot into this boot in order to get it on.	1
The reason	5
I gave it two stars	5
is	5
that once its ON, its fine, and I love fitflops comfort.	1
Get ready to ruin your nails, work up a sweat,	1
and scratch up your fingers getting your foot into the things though.	1

B004SAS28K-0047
The boot looks great.	3
But was unable to slip it on as there are no side zippers.	1 4
Probably i need to order it in a larger size.	7
I like a pair	1
that i can easily slip on and not struggle to put it on.	1
Would recommend getting 1 size larger.	7

B004SAS28K-0074
These are very comfortable.	1
As other reviewers have commented,	5
they can be hard to get on in the first week or so.	1
A tab in the back would help	4
but may be unsightly.	3
The comfort exceeds the slight hassle.	1
Last years version of this boot was a few inches taller	7
and I liked it a bit better.	7
This current style can look a little short	3 7
if you are	3 7
looking to tuck in skinny jeans.	3 7
Nonetheless, I will continue to buy FitFlops as long as they are	1
made because of the comfort.	1
If you plan to wear thick socks for added warmth	7
you may want to go up a half size if available.	7
These do not have a fuzzy warm interior.	4
I would not suggest wearing them in a heavy rain,	8
although have not had any issues	8
while wearing them	8
while running errands during wet rainy Pacific NW winter.	8

B004SAS28K-0100
I like these boots,	5
I bought a pair last year on sale in a different color.	0
I waited	6
until the price was right	6
and ordered these,	6
they arrived the other day.	5
I had to go ONE SIZE DOWN in this style boot.	7
I know	7
that from ordering the size I	7
usually wear last year	7
and had to exchange them.	7
They are a little difficult	1
to get on the first few time,	1
but they do stretch	1 7
and they are just as comfy as all my other FITFLOPS.	1
I have a very nice collection.	5
I also have a thin foot.	5
If you have a wide foot,	7
these are NOT the boots for you.	7
They are cute with jeans and leggings.	3
Thanks!	5

B004UER758-0003
The seam on the top of the foot sits too low and rubs against the top of the foot.	1
Tried multiple sizes and they all had the same seam issue.	1
Very cute	3
if you don't mind a little discomfort and blisters.	1 3
I returned them.	5
Not worth it to me.	5

B004UER758-0007
I was super excited to get these	5
but after on the second day of use one of the metal buttons above the fringe broke off AND the zipper's leather tassel came undone,	2
when I tried to tie it back	2
it would stay tied as well.	2
The shoe its self is stylish,	3
but not good for an every day use. dont waste your money on these,	2
especially if you are looking for a shoe	2
to wear everyday!	2

B004UER758-0020
I wanted a true purple boot,	0
it was a washed purplish but not a true purple,	0
I am always a 9. 5	7
but they were a little long on me.	7
I think overall they were a nice look.	3

B004UER758-0044
I was looking for something comfy	1
that would work for fall --	1
these boots are very nice, well made,	1
but,	5
as other reviewers have pointed out : Narrow.	7
My feet are medium width,	7
and these moccasins were tight.	1 7
They have stretched a little,	5
but here's the thing -	5
the bottom tread is cut to this narrow width.	7
Otherwise, nice,	5
but maybe get a size or half size up	7
and fill in with thick socks	7
to make them fit.	1 7

B004UER758-0084
Minnetonka makes the best moccasins	5
you can buy!	5
The colour is beautiful	0
the attention to detail is great!	3
So well made so very comfortable!	1 2
I get tons of compliments	5
when I wear them!	5
I really love	5
that this is a limited edition item	5
and	5
when they are gone	5
they are gone	5
and I got them!	5
I love the colour plum	0
and it's nice to know	5
that my boots are special!	5

B008BG2IM8-0001
The shoes	5
I ordered	5
were labeled as 10W,	7
but there is no way	7
this shoe is a wide width.	7
I have several pairs of shoes in this style	5
that are wide width	5
and they all fit fine right out of the box.	5
This shoe company needs to assess	5
all their shoes labeled wide width	5
and mark them to USA shoe size standards	5
so they're labeled properly	5
so their customers aren't wasting their time with returning shoes	5
that don't fit.	1

B008BG2IM8-0003
I ordered these a half-size up	7
and they still fit poorly.	1
I wear an average-width size	5
8. 5	5
and I'm not sure	5
whose foot these were intended to fit.	5
I rarely have problems with the size of shoes	5
I order online.	5
The toe box is quite narrow,	1
which is a problem for shoes with a heel of this height.	5
They also look cheap,	3
which I guess	5
they are,	5
but the picture is misleading.	5
I am wondering	5
if they are worth returning or just passing off to someone with narrow feet.	5
I don't think I know anyone	5
who would wear these anyway.	5

B008BG2IM8-0007
I thought	5
the taupe would look like the picture.	3
It does n't.	3
What I received is a grayish brown shoe.	0
I am consistently a size 8 medium shoe.	5
This shoe is snug	1
and my toes	1
hurt after a wearing the shoes a few hours.	1
Since this isn't a leather shoe,	4
it won't adjust to my feet	1
and so will always be just a bit too snug.	1
Although, not excessively small, I would suggest	7
going down a half size.	7
I wear a thin trouser sock with this shoe	5
and it's still too small.	7

B008BG2IM8-0013
I agree with the other reviewers...	5
these run a little narrow.	7
But get the size right and these are awesome.	7
Lots of compliments and the stretchy band helps with the fit	1
--	5
after a few days of breaking them in I can wear them comfortably all day.	1
They look great with jeans -- super cute!	3
I would recommend ordering the wide in your normal shoe size	7
or go up a half size	7
if you normally wear a wide shoe.	7
The soft pillow cushion, wide heel, and soft-arch make them the perfect all-day shoe.	1 4

B008BG2IM8-0016
This is definitely a comfortable shoe.	1
Fits perfect and the insole is soft	1 4
and feels great on my feet.	1
I wear a size 10?1/2	7
I chose size 11.	7
And it fits perfect.	1
Definitely would recommend this shoe,	5
looks sleek, dressy,	3
not to high with the heel, and great with jeans.	3
Love them!	5

B00EFD6B8I-0001
These boots are so cute,	3
but the sole is made of a cheap material	4
and walking in them is squishes down a little...	5
I've worn mine about 10 times	5
and the heels of the shoes are falling apart.	2
I noticed	5
when I first wore them	5
that the heel squishes down	2
as you walk	5
and after the first few times it split open.	2
Ended up getting some shoe goo	5
and filling the entire heel with it	5
because the heel is hollow on the shoes.	4 2
Cute but terrible quality	4 3
if you walk like a normal person...	5

B00EFD6B8I-0007
Very cute boots.	3
Matched my motorcycle jacket perfectly.	3
Very uncomfortable and feet	1
hurt after 30 minutes	1
of wearing	5
while sitting on sofa.	5
Very hard insole	4
that needs more cushion.	4
Great price	6

B00EFD6B8I-0011
They are adorable	3
and look good	3
but are made of very cheap material.	4
I would recommend getting more than one pair	2
or buying higher quality boots	2
if you plan	2
on wearing them every day.	2
One good scrape and the black would come off.	2
I do like them	5
but I'm being honest about the quality.	5
I have yet to have an issue with the heel	2
collapsing but after reading other reviews got a tube of shoe goo in case	5
it happens.	5
They seem pretty solid to me.	2
These are going to be awesome for date nights with my husband but not something	5
that would stand up to much more than that.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0023
I bought these boots for a Halloween costume,	5
but loved them so much	5
that I wear them frequently.	5
I got the color " Tan "	0
which looks exactly as pictured on the website.	0
I ordered a size 9,	7
and I would say	5
they're just slightly too large in the foot area,	1 7
but nothing a pair of fuzzy socks won't fix.	5
My only problem with these boots is	5
that the heel is too soft.	5
Either the rubber	4
they used	5
has too much give in it,	4
or the heels are hollow, or SOMETHING.	4
If you walk hard on your heels,	5
the heel of the boot kind of gives in.	2
Honestly, it's not a big enough problem	5
for me to not wear them.	5
Otherwise, they are AMAZINGLY comfortable.	1
I've worn these all day while working retail,	1
and my feet were perfectly comfortable.	1

B00EFD6B8I-0026
I bought this set for my first ever country concert!	5
I did not want to spend a lot of money on boots,	6
so	5
when I saw these,	5
I decided to give a try.	5
The shipping was fast	5
and they look exactly like the picture.	3
The fit is great too, very comfortable.	1
I am not use to wearing high heels or anything like that	5
so these were a perfect fit.	1
I have worn them a couple of times,	5
and they feel super comfy!	1
I wore them for more than a few hours	1
and my feet felt just fine.	1
If you do not want to spend a lot of money on boots,	6
I highly recommend these, not only are they affordable, but very comfortable!!	6 1
