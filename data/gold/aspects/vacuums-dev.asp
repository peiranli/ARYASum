B00008V40C-0014
Like other reviewers	5
have said, the Dirt Devil Power Stick is a waste of money.	5
It is incredibly noisy,	4
but has little to show for all of the commotion.	5
It has below average perfomance on tile or wood floors	7
and is totally useless on carpet.	7
I threw mine out after just a year ;	5
by the end of the year, I could hardly stand to use it anymore.	5

B00008V40C-0032
I just bought this	5
and used it two times.	5
Like others said,	5
its very powerful.	7
But the power works against it.	7
First of all,	5
when I started it up,	3
it jumped out of my hands.	3
The noise is deafening... seriously.	4
It is much, much louder than my very powerful full upright.	4
My ears actually were ringing	4
when I was done.	4
It also was frustrating	5
because the `` exhaust '' comes out at an angle	7
that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum.	7
The smaller amped Dirt Devil stick vac works much better.	5
I plan to return it for the smaller one.	5

B00008V40C-0048
This vacuum works,	5
but its the LOUDEST VACUUM EVER.	4
Doggies hide, people flee,	4
and your ears will ring.	4
I have owned many vacuums and shop-vacs,	5
and the Dirt Devil Powerstick is the loudest of all.	4
I recommend earplugs with every purchase.	4

B00008V40C-0056
I concur with all of the reviews	5
ranging from 1-5 stars on this vacuum.	5
It is loud	4
and the exhaust does blow very strong.	5
These `` cons '' are attributed to the high power	7
that this unit has.	5
It picks up dirt	7
and long hair very well.	7
And	5
since the vacuum head doesn't have a conventional brushroll,	0
it can not jam with hair.	0
This vacuum is used in an apartment with approximatly 800 sq. ft. with 50/50 carpet and tile floor.	5
It loses one star for the noise	4
... although loud,	4
it is bearable.	4

B00008V40C-0079
For such a small machine it really does have great power.	7
I have four small children.	5
I need to sweep after every meal.	5
This is a lot quicker than sweeping.	5
It's great to suck up cereal, crumbs, hair, etc..	5
Keep in mind it does not have any extra tools or a rotating brush.	0
It mainly has suction power.	7
I love it!	5

B0001WW2F8-0005
I bought this vacumn	5
because I have dogs	5
and I read	5
that it sucks very well and for simpicity of use.	3 7
It features a zero on this front.	5
Its noisy and the filter blocks up	4 0
after one use	5
so you have to clean out the whole system	0
and replacing the filters is more expensive than having bagged vacumn.	0
Its heavy and cumbersome	8
and does not last long belt wise.	1
I have to replace the belt every two months or so.	1
All in all not a very low maintenance vacumn.	5
if you just have light vacumning	5
and not dogs that	5
require daily vacumning of the house then its ok.	5
But one could do better	5
i think.	5
I would not purchase one like this again	5

B0001WW2F8-0015
I have been using this vacuum cleaner for about a year now	5
and I feel	5
it is not a good one	5
(even though I like the bagless feaure, light in weight and an OK price)	6 8
here	5
is why :	5
(1)	5
The suction is WEAK,	7
many reviewers think the opposite	5
and I believe	5
they were mislead by the effect of the powerful brush!	5
The brush scrapped materials from the surface of the carpet	0
and gives false impression	5
that lots of dirt is collected.	5
(2)	5
It picks up dog hair and dust ok, but not even a small object on the floor	7
(especially bear floor	7
without carpet).	7
(3)	5
The brush keeps rolling at high speed	5
even when the vacuum is in up-right position.	5
I think	5
this is really a poor design.	5
(4) Very noisy, it is louder than the one	4
I had before	4
(which was truly a powerful one).	5
If you are looking for serious vac,	5
I do not recommend this one.	5

B0001WW2F8-0024
I purchased this vacuum in May 2005	5
(my first Bissell).	5
I have had continuous problems with the belt	1
breaking or burning.	1
I am on my fifth belt now,	1
which is about one per month.	1
I have never had problems like this before, not even with my old Eureka	5
that I gave away	5
when I got this one	5
(I didn't go through five belts in 6 six years with the Eureka).	5
Otherwise, it seems to work okay, except the Turbo Brush,	0
which is basically useless,	0
and keep your eye on they many filters	0
that need to be cleaned regularly to keep it working well.	0

B0001WW2F8-0028
I absolutely LOVE this vaccuum!	5
This is my third new vaccuum in six months.	5
The others couldn't handle the pet hair like this one.	7
(Two big dogs and a cat!)	5
We have lots of pet hair,	5
and this vaccuum gets up every last bit of dirt and hair.	7
I love the cleaning sensor.	0
It turns green	0
when the floor is completely clean.	0
No more bags!!!	0
It's super easy to empty the dirt	0 3
and clean the filters.	0 3
There are three filters instead of the typical two,	0
allowing the hepa filter	0
to last a longer period of time	0
before replacement is needed -	0
another plus!	0
The turbo brush is my favorite part of this vaccuum.	0
The turbo brush has a self spinner,	0
making vaccuuming the couches and drapes a breeze.	5
The only down side to this vaccuum is	5
that the turbo brush clogs easily,	0
and you have to take the brush apart	0
to remove any pet hair	5
that clogs it.	5
This is the best vaccuum	5
I have ever owned.	5
After two previous bad experiences with vaccuums, this one is a keeper.	5

B0001WW2F8-0049
This is a very good vacuume,	5
it has the best suction of any upright	7
I've ever used,	7
I like the fact its bagless,	0
and I can empty the cup after each use,	0
it goes from carpet to ceramic tile	5
and does a super job on each!	5
you can't go wrong bying this vacuume cleaner!	5
and the price is right	6
also!!	5

B0009RF824-0001
Don't waste your money!	5
The only good suction	7
that the vac has	5
is thru the hose.	7
The hose and the power cord is very short!	3
I have all tile with a few rugs	5
and it doesn't vacuum anything up on both the tile and the rugs.	7
I have to keep going over the same spot over and over again just to get a couple of crumbs vacuumed.	7

B0009RF824-0012
Purchased this vac. to perform quick clean up jobs	5
and was quite impressed with it	5
when I saw it in the store	5
as it is quite light and compact.	8
It has a major problem however	5
and that is	5
that it won't pick up anything on a carpet surface.	7
It dosen't produce much suction	7
which is probably the fault of an undersized motor.	7
It works a little better on hard surfaced floors but the design of the air discharge directly in the front the unit blows the dust away from the front of the cleaner head	5
making it a challange	5
to catch up with the dust bunnies.	5
I wouldn't waste the money on this cleaner	5
unless you enjoy going through the motions just for the arm exercise.	5
I gave the unit two stars	5
only because it has a nice automatic cord retractor.	3
Too bad	5
that they couldn't have provided a vacume cleaner	5
to go along with it.	5

B0009RF824-0015
It won't pick up any lint on my area rug,	7
but it does a great job on the bare floors.	7
I need one	5
that does both carpet and floors	5
(I don't have enough storage for both),	5
so I'm taking this one back.	5
I don't know	5
why this is tagged as cordless,	5
it has a cord.	5

B0009RF824-0019
I bought this to clean my laminate wood floors.	5
I wanted something	5
that wouldn't kill my back,	5
was light weight,	8
and didn't tear up my floor.	5
This fits the bill.	5
It is not as powerful as my upright Hoover	7
but it's more convenient.	3
The cord retracts	3
which is nice.	3
It has onboard tools	0
and in a flash I can get into the corners and baseboards with the hose.	0 3
It picks up pretty good	7
but lint gets stuck on the little bottom wheels.	5
Also, it is ESSENTIAL the filter be cleaned often otherwise it doesn't pick up well.	0 7
The filter is easy to clean ;	0
I just take it out back	5
and hose it off.	5
I paid $ 50 for it	6
and think	6
it's worth	6
it.	6
Just be sure	5
and clean the filter	0
and don't expect a regular vaccum in this little guy.	5

B0009RF824-0024
if you know	5
what your doing,	5
this vacuum is awesome!	5
I need a small light weight vacuum for my hardwood floors.	8
I am handycaped,	5
and need something light and easy to maneuver,	8 3
the retractable cord makes it so much easier,	3
and emptying it is a snap.	3
It is so lightweight	8
that I can even carry it myself.	8
I bought it to put in my RV	5
because it is easy to store in a small place	5
and the handle even breaks down.	5
The suction is very good.	7
I could not imagine anything	5
working better.	5

B0009WRKSO-0059
I am finally giving in	5
and buying a new one	5
and will be happy to trash this one!	5
From the beginning it would clog up on a regular basis	5
and I would have to disassemble the whole thing to find the clog.	3
I can NOT get it to pick up at all on low carpets,	7
it just spits out the dirt.	5
It will not pick up anything	7
using just the hose.	7
THe latch	0
that holds it upright	5
doesn't work,	5
the pet hair attachment never really worked.	0
It isn't the color of a lemon for nothing!	5

B0009WRKSO-0101
The vacuum has good suction	7
and the brush attachment works great.	0
The filter cover barley hangs on	0 1
and	5
if you bump it,	0 1
it falls off easily.	0 1
When the canister is about half full dirt starts	0
to build up in the path from the filter	0
and the filter gets giant wads of dirt on it also.	0
The spin duster does not really spin that great,	5
nor does it pick up much dust.	5
Overall I was	5
disappointed by this product	5
and will more than likely be returning it to the store	5
i bought it from	5

B0009WRKSO-0108
I wanted a new vaccuum	5
because my old one was heavy	5
and had a short on board hose.	5
Well guess what, now I have another heavy vaccuum with a short hose.	8 3
I read negative reviews about this product	5
before I purchased it	5
but decided to ignore them	5
and purchase it	5
because the features looked impressive.	5
It is a powerful vaccum for the money but the spinning duster only `` spun '' maybe twice	6 0 7
so I just clean it the old fashioned way with the hose.	5
I purchased the only extension hose	0
that Eureka makes	0
and it is so long there is very little suction	0 7
so I just deal with the `` too-short '' hose.	5
I suggest Eureka skip the duster on their next model	5
and go for the longer hose	5
if you want to impress me!!!	5
I did give this product three stars though for cleaning ability.	7

B0009WRKSO-0113
For the money, this vacuum is so much more than I expected.	6
It is lightweight	8
and has a lot of suction.	7
The only drawbacks	5
I have	5
are	5
that the accessories won't stay intact.	0
The air filter cover and extend want keep popping off	0
and falling off as well as the duster cap.	0
I have owned a lot of vacuums	5
and by far, this is the best one for the money.	6

B0009WRKSO-0119
This product is excellent	5
and works exactly as it suggests.	5
The edge cleaning is better	5
than I have ever seen.	5
The telescopic duster is wonderful.	0
This product is the best of its kind.	5

B000BXKIE4-0002
The vacuum was used about 20 minutes per week but only lasted about 3 years before electrical connection in the swivel portions of the hose started to fail.	1
(We went through about 4 or 5 bags in the entire life of the vacuum.)	0
Pros : Was fairly quiet, good suction.	4 7
Cons : Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.	1
Summary : Will never buy an Electrolux again.	5

B000BXKIE4-0031
The canister is lightweight, quite powerful and reasonably quiet.	4 8 7
BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction.	4 0 3
The power nozzle also is self-propelled	3
and takes the person vacuuming on a speed race around the carpet.	3
The floor brush is wide	0
and makes for quick cleaning of wide expanses of floor.	0
BUT, it is so wide	0 3
as to be awkward getting into corners and around furniture.	0 3
The telescoping wand is convenient.	0
Storage of two of the tools on the handle is not ;	3
the tools keep falling off.	5
The power cord is short.	3
The hose is too flexible ;	3
it kinks easily.	3
I would prefer to have the on/off button on the handle of the cleaner not the cannister.	3
I have had this not even a week,	5
and already I am disappointed in both the design and the materials	1
used in construction.	1
Added three days after the intial review :	5
The crevice brush is not long enough	0 3
to reach in many common crevices, such as those in a car or under a refrigerator.	0 3
The prongs of the plug had to be separated a bit so the plug does not fall out of the wall socket.	5

B000BXKIE4-0040
I wanted a strong Vac	5
that is why I choose the canister electrolux.	5
Is very light weight and not very loud.	4 8
It does seem to shut down	5
while using it.	5
The attachments are ok	0
could be better.	0
While moving around the canister gets	3
stuck on the cord.	3
I wish	5
I had tryed it out in a store first even thou	5
it has so so power	7
it won't pick up the carpet pile very well.	7
I had inhouse Vac for years	5
then moved	5
and new house wasn't plumbed for in house	5
and was forced to buy Vac.	5
I will be buying another Vac but upright this time less worries of pulling a canister behind me I still give it a 3 star	5
but will have to give it a 0 for ease of using around house.	3

B000BXKIE4-0049
Vacuum is quiet	4
and performs well.	7
Removes dog hair from a rug	5
that 3 other vacs left in place.	5
Easy to carry.	3
My only reservation is an excess of buttons and features - typical of all modern gadgets, not only this vac!	0

B000BXKIE4-0062
Awesome vacuum, quiet as a mouse.	4
Does a great job on the carpet	7
and getting under and around things.	5
Replacement bags a little pricey but well worth it.	5
This is a very nice product!	5

B003CUQJZK-0002
I very much regret buying this vacuum.	5
It looses suction	7
when the vacuum bag is only half full	7
and the bags are not cheap.	6 0
But the worst thing about this vacuum is	3
that it will not roll behind me.	3
It flops onto its side	3
and I have to drag it around.	3
I contacted a Miele dealer	2
who said	5
it was a common problem	2
but they would not help me	2
because I purchased from Amazon.	2
I recently contacted Miele customer service	2
which is absolutely horrible!	2
It took multiple emails	2
before there was a response	5
and once they responded	2
they chose to ignore the issue of the vacuum falling on its side.	2
It took two more emails to get this response " Unfortunately	2
it has	5
been recognized	5
that this can be an issue.	5
There is no fix for this. "	5

B003CUQJZK-0009
After using a Kirby vacuum system for several years,	5
we were ready to try something lighter and less complicated.	5
After trying the Miele,	5
I am not satisfied for a few reasons :	5
1	5
The power cord is too short.	3
I even have to replug the vacuum	5
in when I'm half way down the stairs.	5
2	5
When using the vacuum on hard floors,	5
some of the dirt/sand gets pushed to the edge of the wall	5
and this vacuum does not have enough suction	7
to get the dirt	5
that is on the edge or corners of the floors.	5
I have to use a separate attachment,	5
which means vacuuming takes me twice as long!	3
3	5
The bags are small.	0
They fill up quickly,	0
and they are expensive.	6 0
It is quiet and light weight,	4 8
but I feel	5
that it just doesn't cut it	5
when it comes to cleaning.	5
I didn't have any of these issues with my Kirby.	5
I will be returning this item,	5
and looking for a new Kirby.	5

B003CUQJZK-0022
Bought this product	5
after my Kenmore finally conked out.	5
The suction is good as well as the filtering of the air...	7
but because there are only three wheels,	5
it is constantly falling over.	3
The air exhaust	5
is on the top of the canister and blows up.	5
This is annoying	5
if you stand over the canister.	5
The cord is much shorter	3
than my Kenmore was	5
so you have to constantly replug it in.	3
The ring	5
that holds the tools around the hose	5
gets stuck with the hose	5
when you rotate it.	5
And the rug beater doesn't do shag	0
(of which I have several shag rugs).	5
I've had Electrolux and Kenmore vacuums	5
and would say	5
they were much consumer friendly.	5

B003CUQJZK-0036
I really like the suction of this vacuum.	7
The carpet cleaning tool is hard to push	3
unless you turn the suction back.	5
I would rate it 5 star,	5
but the brush for hardwood floors is a little too big.	0
It is awkward	3
trying to get in close places and corners.	3

B003CUQJZK-0062
This vacuum is light, quiet, and powerful.	4 8 7
Blows away all of the Kenmore vacuums	5
we've owned in the past.	5
One slight detractor is	5
that there's no on-board storage for the parquet floor attachment	0
as there is for the other attachments.	0
But I figured out	5
that it can hang on the back next to the power cord on the clip	5
that supposed	5
to hold the power head.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0000
But this broke after only one use.	1
It simply quit working.	1
It seemed great,	5
but while cleaning the house the first time	1
using the vacuum,	1
it burnt out,	1
and we have an average household with some dog hair,	5
that had been cleaned only two weeks prior.	5
Probably just a bad unit, but can not recommend regardless.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0002
Missing hose extension and smelled of something burning	0 1
when turn on.	1
A Hoover representative told me	2
that the smell was from a lubricate	2
and would dissipate with after time.	2
Still waiting	2

B005ZFUKG4-0005
I wont have this vacuum	5
to clean the floor at home	5
it is not enough power,	7
but I bought it for a ceramic floor and it's ok.	7
I will like it better	5
if Hoover make the wireless version. : -)	5
Hoover Handheld Canister Vacuum - SH10010	5

B005ZFUKG4-0007
This is a great vacuum.	5
The suction is superb ;	7
it picks up the dirt in my tile's grout lines	7
that my old Ergorapido used to leave behind.	7
Unfortunately, the HEPA filter is small.	0
It requires lots of emptying, or, potentially, lots of replacing.	0
If I were to discard and replace the filter	0
after it filled up,	0
this would be an expensive system.	0
As it is,	5
I don't have allergies,	5
so I just take the filter to the garbage can outside	0
and shake it out.	0
This has saved me from having to buy new filters every week or so.	5
I realize	5
not everyone can empty dusty filters the way	5
I do,	5
but this has been a money-saver for us.	5
I would recommend this vacuum to anyone,	5
as it is lightweight, easy to store, and performs well.	3 8 7

B005ZFUKG4-0013
Love this! gave my sister one	5
too her apt is tiny	5
and this is really a mighty mini.	3
A pleasure	5
to throw away the dirt,	5
bags are big and easy to get on amazon.	5
Will never have a bagless vac again.	5
I also have the upright and love that too. worth every penny.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0002
My wife purchased this vacuum from Amazon less then two weeks ago	5
and it is already having major problems.	1
The vacuum overheats	1
and shuts itself off after less then 5 minutes.	1
The motor sounds	4
like it is ready to explode.	4
We have checked for any clogs, jams etc..	5
It is just poorly built.	1
If we had not already tossed the box,	5
this would be going back.	5
I expected alot more from Panasonic.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0008
We have the older version of this vacuum.	5
It was purchased because of it's light weight and our past history with Panasonic vacuums.	8
The bottom line is not impressed.	5
In not so high pile carpet the beater brush just bogs down makes the unit almost impossible to push forward.	3
Other complaints :	5
the hose is way too short	0
and where the hose attaches pops out unannounced.	0 1
So you are happily sweeping	5
and the dirt is being blown back into the room.	5
I would never buy another Panasonic	5
without a trial period and the ability	5
to return it.	5
Just not up to the standards of the old Panasonic bag sweepers.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0014
BEWARE!	5
This is little vacuum works absolutely terrific on low pile carpet and even bare tile floors!	5
However,	5
unlike what it claims to,	5
it will not adjust to different carpet pile heights.	3
It bogs down on higher pile carpet	1 3
and doesn't do a good job.	1 3
It's almost impossible to vacuum it at all.	3
I really didn't discover this	5
until after I had it for more than 30 days	5
or I would have returned it.	5
If the one I have is defective,	5
I'm open to exchanging it for an properly operational one.	5
Hope the seller sees this!	5
I'm very disappointed.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0044
This is my first bagless vacuum.	5
I bought it	5
after viewing a very helpful video,	5
and thought	5
it would be perfect for a small apartment.	5
It was easy to assemble,	3
and I used it immediately.	3
So far, I like it	5
because I can see how much dust it picks up	7
and it's so easy	3
to empty the canister.	3
Just a minor drawback for me is its weight.	8
It's supposed to be light weight,	8
and I guess	8
that's probably so.	8
For me, however, just a little heavier than I thought.	8
But maneuvering is easy,	3
and as I use it more,	5
I probably won't feel it that heavy.	8

B007LZ9LV6-0050
This is one of if not my favorite vacuum cleaners!	5
First off considering the size	8
(full size vacuum),	8
this one is lightweight!	8
It's not silent,	4
but compare it with others of this size,	4
and it's much more quiet.	4
And the weight.	8
Very light compared to other others of this size.	8
Cord rolls inside the vacuum	0
so that you don't have to roll it up on the back of the cleaner	0 3
(where the cord falls down, etc.).	3
Personally I like this.	5
Nice and neat.	5
Suction power is excellent!	7
This gets down into the thick plush rugs.	7
Really picks up dirt, grind, hair, etc..	7
Comes with your standard attachments.	0
Nothing special there.	5
Keep in mind it's a `` bagless '' vacuum.	5
So when you empty it,	5
you are	5
gon na want to go outside	3
as when you empty it,	3
most likely it will give off a dust cloud	3
(if you are not very, very careful).	5
Panasonic has a winner here.	5

B00A7D2L84-0003
This is my second Samsung vacuum,	5
The fist one was the Robotic,	5
Cost me $ 599.	5
Let along it didn't do the job,	5
but it broke after 3 months.	5
Samsung refused to repair	5
and turned me around.	5
But let's talk about this one.	5
It has absolutely no suction power.	7
When you use the power brush,	0 7
it's more or less OK,	0 7
but without it there is absolutely NO SUCTION.	0 7
The dust bag and all snappers are so flimsy	0 1
and can be broke so easily.	0 1
The vacuum stop	1
working couple of times due to it	1
was overheated.	1
So I had to wait 15 minutes or so to resume vacuuming.	5
I would not recommend this Vacuum to anyone.	5

B00A7D2L84-0006
Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke	1
as I was vacuuming.	5
Spent over an hour on the phone with customer service	2
just to find out	2
that they would have the service department contact me within 3 business days.	2
Very frustrating!!!	5
Vacuum worked fine up until this point.	5
Very disappointed!	5

B00A7D2L84-0009
Consumer reports gave this a good rating	5
and it does a good job cleaning	5
but there are a couple of things	5
that could have been better.	5
The most annoying problem is	5
that the attachments do not fit on the unit	0
so you can't conveniently switch them.	0
Also,	5
to remove hair and string	3
that gets wrapped around the rollers	3
you have to remove several screws	3
to take off the plate in order	3
to get to the rollers.	3
One other thing	5
that is a nuisance is	5
that there are 2 power buttons, one on the handle and one on the canister,	5
sometimes the one on the handle does not work	5
so I have to use the button on the unit.	5
I have had the vacuum cleaner for only a couple of months	5
so I am hoping	5
that the power button on the canister doesn't start having glitches too.	5

It seems	5
like it is getting difficult to find good canister vacuums nowadays.	5
This one is about as good	5
as they come.	5
I agree with others	5
that it should have an indicator	5
showing	5
if you are	5
running the Low, Med, or high speed on the brush.	5
You can normally tell by the sound	5
but it isn't always easy.	5
Love the bagless design and good performance.	5
It is hard to please my wife	5
and this one made her happy,	5
so that is a big plus.	5

I love this vacuum!	5
It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.	4 7
I love	0
that it came with a hardwood attachment.	0
The power brush is amazing.	0
I have two cats	5
so it is extremely nice	5
that it filters the dander out of the air	0
while you vacuum.	5
I highly recommend this vacuum over the higher priced versions.	5

I bought this vacuum cleaner from Best Buy in December	5
after ordering and returning a $ 519 Dyson Animal vacuum cleaner	5
that arrived with a sheared off wheel.	5
(Dyson is made entirely of plastic).	5
This Hoover is great on my wood floors,	5
the hose is easy to whip out and use,	3
and the vacuum is lightweight and maneuvers nicely.	8 3
On the downside,	5
it doesn't suck well on carpets	7
and the brush roll turns itself off after a pass or two on the carpet.	0
These problems i dealt with.	5
However, one day recently the brush roll button wouldn't turn on the brush roll.	0 1
I looked at the Hoover self help videos,	2
but they were useless.	2
I think	1
it is an electrical issue.	1
I've taken the vacuum cleaner apart	5
and there are no obstructions,	5
the belt looks fine, and so on.	5
Technically it is still under warranty	5
but I didn't keep my Best Buy receipt	5
so we registered it late and still haven't gotten a warranty card in the mail.	2
What a waste of $ 200.	6

I'm very disappointed.	5
This vacuum cleaner seemed so great at first.	5
It's very light and compact.	8
It has good suction	7
for cleaning hard floors,	7
which is mostly	5
what I'm interested in.	5
The way the attachments work is very clever and efficient.	0 3
I also like the way you can easily turn on or off the brush roller	0 3
if you need	5
to clean both hard floors and carpet.	5
All that is great,	5
but after using it only a few times,	1
the brush roller would not turn on anymore.	1
I tried cleaning the brush,	5
which wasn't fouled or dirty	5
because I've hardly	5
used it.	5
Still it will not turn on.	1
I read some of the reviews here on Amazon	5
and I saw	5
that a lot of other people have	5
run into the same problem with the brush roller not turning on	1
and they have not had much luck	5
with fixing it.	5
So you can buy this vacuum	5
if you like the features,	5
but be prepared for the brush roller	1
to stop working after a short period.	1

Cleans great	5
but it's heavy and hard to push, especially on large area rugs	8 3
that have a solid backing.	5
It seems to suck down	3 7
and be difficult to move.	3
We have two small dogs	5
and it does a really good job	7
of picking up the dog hair.	7
We also have hardwoods with area rugs.	5
It cleans	5
both well but is a little more work on the area rugs	3
than I'd like.	3
On the second floor we have wall-to-wall carpet	3
and it is not as difficult to push.	3
All in all its OK.	5
If you don't have any dense area rugs	5
it might be rated higher.	5

Very good vacuum for the price.	6
No need to spend your money on the pricey Dyson.	6
We had a Dyson before,	5
and I feel its very overpriced.	5
The Wind Tunnel does	5
exactly what the Dyson can do.	5
The suction on this vacuum is very strong.	7
I vacuum everyday and so far I think its great.	5
Vacuuming on hard floors works very well too.	3
Its well built,	1
sturdy but easy to manuever.	1 3
Some cons :	5
The cord is very short.	0
Also,	5
emptying the canister requires both hands.	0
Dust will get all over your hands.	5
Switching to use	3
the hose is messy	0 3
as it involves flipping up a flap	3
where the dust goes through,	3
dust falls to floor in that area.	5
I would recommend this.	5
You can get 2 of these for 1 Dyson.	5

This vacuum is amazing!	5
Effortless manuevering with the twist of a wrist.	3
The hose/handle attachment is great for getting to hard to reach places.	0
Extremely powerful suction picked up anything in it's way.	7
Emptying the canister is as easy	3
as pressing a button.	3
The filtration system is wonderful,	0
helping with our indoor allergies.	0
