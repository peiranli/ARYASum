Not meant for the HDTV / LCD times.	5
After 45 min. the RF IN stopped working,	1
so Magnavox needs me to MAIL in the TV for replacement.	2
This is the worst attempt of HDTV	5
I ever seen.	5
It is like a no name brand	5
that should be blank.	5
I would not buy a Magnavox anything	5
Digital Video display again.	5
Everyday the set looks	5
as if it ages 1 year	5
and if it last longer,	5
that would be the only good thing to say.	5
The TV sounds	8
as if lightning is going through the speakers	8
and is as bad as the display	8 4
which looks like lightning struck it.	4
No way will you ever get a picture	5
that looks like Magnavox 15MF605T 15 '' LCD Flat Panel TV image on the web page.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0007
Cable picture is poor.	4
Sound is terrible.	8
Despite matching its progressive scan capabilities with a progressive scan DVD player,	5
it DID NOT meet George Lucas ' picture specifications	5
(which can be accomplished by tube-televisions over 10 years old).	5
Too bad	5
Sony has	5
discontinued making anything under 20 ''. Bottom line is -	5
if you have an eye and ear for detail - do not buy this TV.	8 4

B000AB2ZDE-0011
The color and definition are excellent.	4
We wanted a small TV for our kitchen counter...	5
and it fit the bill,	5
it seemed.	5
Not so fast...	5
it's loudest volume has us straining to hear.	8
The good thing is we are a bit quieter at dinner,	8
or we can't hear the TV.	8
However, I am told,	5
If I have the room for unsightly wires,	5
I can add speakers to help this situation disappear...	5
but, why would I want to clutter the area with more stuff?	5
So,	5
it would be best to buy this TV for a bedroom or child's room, and not a busy area...	5
or you'll be doing a lot of shushing!	5

B000AB2ZDE-0014
I had to take the first one back... fuzzy fonts, ghosting, and one dead pixel.	4
So I took it back to the retailer	5
where I got a GREAT deal on this TV,	5
and the second unit	5
I tried worked perfectly with a much improved picture, expecially on the XBox.	4
I bought this for my son for Christmas	5
so I'm glad to know	5
it doubles	5
as a computer monitor with a built in VGA port.	1
That'll save some money.	5
Nice and bright with good colors, I like it.	4
BTW, the retailer	5
I returned the first unit too	5
commented	5
they had taken `` a lot '' of these back today.	5
Not worth $ 300,	6
but if you can find it for a steal...	5

B000AB2ZDE-0019
I've had this TV	5
Since 2005	5
and I bought it for my bedroom.	5
It's been	5
when they first started coming out	5
and it was all	5
I could afford at the time	5
but it has been a great tv no complaints.	5
When I watch tv in bed	5
and my hubby needs to sleep I change the picture	4
setting so its not too bright cause there	4 3
is so many different settings.	3
I live this TV.	5
But it's time	5
to get a bigger tv	5
and sell this one.	5
It has been nothing but great to me!!!	5
One of the best tv 's!!!	5

B001TA6CAM-0001
Like so many other reviews, I too have the same issue after a few years of use.	5
The set shuts off	3
and then cycles on and off with any HD input signal.	1 3
I can only watch standard channels from my cable box	1
and can't watch movies at all from my computer.	1
Toshiba knows	5
they produced a lemon	5
but will do nothing about it.	5
They have lost my business forever.	5
A television should last much longer than 3 years!!!!	5

B001TA6CAM-0010
Purchased 10mo ago in 8/2009, and as soon	5
as warranty has expired i started	5
having issues.	5
Of course Toshiba would not speak to me	2
unless i paid for technician	2
to come over	2
and fix it.	2
I won't buy any Toshiba products anymore.	5
Not reliable.	5

B001TA6CAM-0013
I've had this tv for about a month now.	5
Overall, it's an ok tv.	5
My biggest issue with the image quality.	4
I've fiddled with the preferences a bit	5
but still can't fix the problem.	5
The overall colors are alright,	4
black levels are good.	4
BUT - there is a noticeable and irritating `` trace '' effect with the color red.	4
Especially if a person has really red lips, as their head moves,	5
there's a trace of red	4
that follows.	5
Same affect with quick body movement.	4
I have over the air tv	5
(which I understand,	5
is part of the problem)	5
-	5
so even programs	4
that are broadcast in HD	4
still have traces.	4
And I still have this problem with DVDs and video games,	4
even when I use higher end connections	1 4
(like the hdmi).	1
Is there a certain setting	5
I should have?	5
Or this a problem with the tv?	5
If it is,	5
I am very disappointed in the quality of this tv.	5

B001TA6CAM-0015
There are some great reviews already in place on this TV,	5
so I'll keep it simple.	5
I managed to purchase this TV for 340	6
when I caught it on sale just before black friday	5
(thanks Amazon!).	5
And for the money I don't think	5
I could have asked for more!	5
There are a few presets in place already for picture settings,	5
but I recommend using the one	5
that's supplied in one of the reviews here.	5
Beautiful colors and crisp quality of images in this TV.	4
Has 2 HDMI slots in the back as well as 2 component and 2 A/V and S-Video.	1
One of my absolute favorite features is	3
that each input can have its own customized picture settings!!!	3
So no worries about having to reset them	5
each time you use them.	5
The only thing about this TV lacking is the sound options.	8
You really don't have any sort of settings to change or improve	8
and the overall sound is fairly good, but nothing amazing.	8
A sound bar or surround sound system will be needed to give you the true HD viewing experience	8
one would want.	5
That 's	5
why I give this gem of a TV a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.	5
But	5
if you're not a sound junkie or don't mind buying a sound bar	8
then you've found	5
what I believe to be the best 32 ''	5
720p TV under 400 dollars!!!	6

B001TA6CAM-0022
This is my first HDTV	5
that I have bought,	5
simply put, gorgeous!!	5
The picture on this tv is super crisp.	4
The blacks are incredible,	4
my only complaint	8
which is minor	5
is the sound,	8
the sound is great	8
but there is a bit of vibration	8
when it's set too loud.	8
I have noticed no ghosting at all!	5
which is surprising for a 60hz LCD.	5
Perfect for any type of gaming, Forza 3, MW2, Mass effect 2.	5
All in all for the price, this baby is great!	6

B004HYG9V4-0002
I am very disappointed with this TV for two reasons : picture brightness and channel menu.	4 3
The picture looked dull and not bright at all even compared to my 6-year old Sony LCD TV.	4
This issue was seen on both cable channels and DVD.	4
About the channel menu issue,	3
since I do not own the cable box,	5
I had to use the QCAM to scan channel from the cable line directly.	3
Because of this, I had a lot of unwanted channels	3
that this TV does not allow me to remove from the channel list.	3
Samsung TV does.	5
Because of these two issues, I returned the Sony TV	5
and purchase the Samsung UN40D5500.	5
The picture looks excellent.	4
However, this Samsung TV does not integrated WI-FI.	1

B004HYG9V4-0010
Unit developed a high pitch whine	8
and was replaced with a refurbished unit.	2
The replacement unit failed within two months.	5
Waiting for the second replacement unit.	2
I WAS a dedicated Sony customer.	5
Their service is handled off shore making communication a bit difficult. : (	2

B004HYG9V4-0013
Picture is crisp and clear with lots of options	4
to change for personal preferences.	5
However, the streaming speed for netflix is just down right terrible. most of the time I just quit	1 0
watching it	0
and use my xbox to watch netflix anymore.	5
But other than that not much to really complain about.	5

B004HYG9V4-0022
I have owned this television for almost a year	5
and have been extremely happy with it.	5
I watch cable, Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube videos and computer movie files on it.	0
What I like best are the many ports - 4 hdmi, 1 component, 1 composite and 1 USB.	1
Also you can change the display and sound settings on each port.	8 1 4
The sound is good and strong.	8
The picture is beautiful.	4
There have been a couple of problems.	5
I have Comcast digital cable	1
and it will not work with an HDMI connection because of a conflict with Comcast's DHCP.	1
So, I have the cable	1
connected to the component port	1
and it does have a nice HD picture.	1 4
Once in a while lately, the tv turns itself off.	5
I don't know	5
what this problem is,	5
but 95 % of the time it does not do this.	5
So I leave well enough alone.	5
Maybe I have an incorrect setting.	5
You can connect a USB external hard drive	1
or flash drive to the USB port,	1
and it will play movies, but not. avi files.	1
Also you can play movies from your computer thru the DLNA,	1
if you have it enabled on your computer.	1
But again, you can't play. avi files.	1

B004HYG9V4-0037
Unbelieveable picture and the setup is so easy.	4 3
We keep saying	5
wow look at the color, look at the sharpness of the picture, amazing.	4
So easy to change sound tracking, cool.	8
Love this TV great size for the bedroom, would go bigger in a livingroom, bigger	7
would be better.	7
Sound is good much better	8
than most TV 's	8
but speakers would really help.	8

B00752R89C-0001
Took it out of the box, plugged it it, put it back in the box.	5
To my way	5
of thinking	5
it's not that the sound quality is poor,	8
it is	5
that the sound quality is not worthy of a shippable product.	8
I bought this 24 inch TV for my kitchen wall	5
to replace a 10 year old Sanyo set	5
and the Sanyo sounds ten times better.	8
Who cares	5
if the picture is decent	4
if the sound is horrible.	8
AND there is no way to hook up a set of small powered computer speakers as far as I know.	1
The set has an odd RCA like `` Digital Audio Output ''	1
port	5
that the Panasonic tech swears	1
is an optical audio output.	1
Huh?	5
Read the manual guys.	5

B00752R89C-0008
Bought this tv elsewhere,	5
but after a year and a few months,	5
it went out on me.	5
The power button cuts on,	5
but there is no picture,	4
its completely black.	5
And	5
when i try to turn it off,	3
it wont cut off,	3
the red power button stays on,	3
unless i unplug.	3
-- Im not the only person	5
who has had this exact problem with the Panasonic Viera tv.	5
Panasonic really needs to check this out,	5
& make better tvs.	5
Called around & everyone told me	5
I'd have to pay a $ 49 diagnostic fee, + plus 100 +	2
to get it fixed.	2
If thats the case	5
I might as well buy a new tv,	5
they run for $ 199-300.	5
I'm not going to buy a new tv every 2 years	5
just because they make bad quality tvs.	5
If thats the case i	5
can go back the fat screens	5
that lasted 15 years.	5
** ATTENTION Panasonic fix this!	5
Til then i'll stick with another brand.	5

B00752R89C-0017
Needed a small set for my home/office.	5
This size was perfect.	7
I did read prior reviews on the issues	5
if this not being full HD.	4
But,	5
for the holiday season	5
lightening deal price it was still to good pass up as this is not my primary TV,	5
but perfect for the home/office.	5
By far NOT the best Panny product,	5
but rather have this than some off brand no name TV with worse quality	5
withing the price range.	6

B00752R89C-0036
This is a nice TV	5
when you want one for a smaller room.	5
The picture is great	4
and the sound is ok.	8
If you want better sound,	5
you can always get a sound bar.	5
I am going to be hooking this TV up to my son's playstation soon so	5
that he can use it to play video games	5
and watch movies.	5

B00752R89C-0053
I chose this rating by the sheer approval	5
my parents gave this TV.	5
The quality of the picture is beyond adequate for what they 're	4
using it for.	4
They have	5
placed it in their camper.	5
The lighting the screen emits is very vibrant and the colors show up very well.	4
Blu-Ray's and DVD's look great.	4
The audio is above what i expected from a 24-Inch TV.	8
I tested it with First-Person Shooters on the Xbox 360	5
and it was topnotch.	5
The size of the hardware is slim	7
and fits perfectly in their cubbyhole	7
they 've	5
set it up in.	5
It stands sturdy	5
and hasn't fallen over	5
while they've moved the camper from camp ground to camp ground.	5
I'd suggest this TV for anyone	5
who wants a solid unit!	5
Hope this helps someone out there!	5

B0077D1LTW-0001
Although the TV itself is fine,	5
if you're buying this for the Samsung Smart TV capability,	0
do n't!	0
It depends on connecting to the Samsung servers through your internet connection,	1
and on some days, their servers are overwhelmed	1
and you can't connect.	1
Which means you can't access Hulu or Netflix	1 0
or whatever else you'd like to watch.	1 0
Very frustrating to spend the extra money on this TV and then not have the service be available	6
when you'd like to watch something.	6

B0077D1LTW-0015
Pros :	5
TV is nice with big screen, good color, great sound & 3D	8 4 7
which all normal 3D television has...	5
Cons :	5
It really lacks in smartness	0
as we can't watch videos	0
(flash files)	0
from internet & it won't let you to download	1 0
flash/any files to get it done.	1 0
you have to update with new firmware	1
but the worst part is Samsung	2
don't have a firmware with latest flash & DIVX file support as of today	2
(09 July 2012).	5

B0077D1LTW-0029
The TV picture is fine.	4
The rub is	5
the Apps didn't work after the first week.	0
My TV is connected to the internet	1
but receiving errors like ERROR_EXE_001 & ERROR_MODEL_BIND.	1
I can not get onto netflix	0
or browse the internet.	1 0
According to some research I have done	5
the issue is on Samsungs end with their servers not handling traffic well.	1
I wouldn't suggest buying this TV for the " Smart " features.	5

B0077D1LTW-0051
It arrived on time to my house undamaged.	2
It was fairly straightforward to setup,	3
although you will probably want to have another person help out.	3
This thing is huge!	7
it doesn't weigh that much for how big it is its just awkward.	7
The 3d works fine	5
if you are into that.	5
The smart hub is alright,	0
some of the apps work better than others.	0
The most important part is the picture quality,	4
and that is excellent.	4
One thing	5
that would be nice is an hdmi out	1
it would make having a homet heater setup	1
and using the smart hub a little easier.	1 3

B0077D1LTW-0087
I did not calibrate it yet,	5
but in Movie mode the picture quality is fantastic, deep warm colors, black blacks, sharp details.	4
I had friends over	5
and every single person was amazed by the picture.	4
The pentile matrix of 60 inch screen doesn't make any difference from my viewing difference of 9 feet,	4 7
but	5
if you plan to sit closer to this TV	5
you might be better off with LG or Panasonic. 3D is great,	5
however having extra glasses over my prescription glasses is annoying.	5
If you can get 65 inch	7
without 3D for the same price you	7
should consider it.	7
But I am also planning to play some 3D games	5
so I will keep this set.	5
Sound quality is decent	8
and it is loud enough	8
unless your air conditioner is very noisy.	5
Overall I am more than happy with this TV,	5
it looks oh so much better than in the store when at home without extra lights.	7

B007IO38MI-0000
I was given my TV as a gift,	5
it didn't last a year.	5
What a POS, not too mention the " help desk " were not helpful at all.	2
It's more hassel	5
than it's worth.	5
Spend a little more money	5
and get a decent TV.	5

B007IO38MI-0006
Yes, the picture is good.	4
It's lightweight.	7
It would be fine for a guest bedroom	5
where it is used only occasionally.	5
The sound is so tinny	8
-- even after adjusting the bass and treble --	8
that I do not recommend it for everyday use.	8

B007IO38MI-0009
This is my 1st flat screen	5
and for the price I am satisfied.	6
The sound is weird on it...	8
so if you are wanting to jam out to MTV,	5
I wouldn't use this.	8
But for a small bedroom tv it does	5
what I need it to do.	5
Again the price was the reason	6
I got it.	6
The picture is just fine.	4
Nice clear color and sharp picture.	4

B007IO38MI-0012
Bought this little TV for my exercise room	5
and it really nice for this application.	5
Gave it 4 stars because the sound is really kinda `` tinny ''.	8
(most of these thin tv's have room for improvement	8
with there speakers)	8
Has a real nice picture	4
and seems to work just great.	5
I'm happy with it!...	5
Penny	5

B007IO38MI-0019
This is a good secondary TV, one for the guest bedroom or the RV, or for use	5
as a computer monitor	5
if you don't need a large one.	5
It's very compact and light,	7
so you can easily move it from room to room.	7
The picture is not only good,	4
it's good from several angles.	4
I like old movies,	5
and the black-and-white contrast in this TV is better than the grayed-out one of a 27-inch LED TV	4
I recently bought at almost three times the price.	5
As with every TV I've owned in recent years,	5
you can get several picture aspects : 4 : 3 normal, 16 : 9 widescreen, zoom, or cinema.	5
The sound is not great,	8
but it's pretty good,	8
and	5
(if you want)	5
you can turn it to quite loud.	8
This TV does boot rather slowly	5
(the picture is slow to appear),	5
and changing channels is also slow,	5
but I can live with that.	5
The remote control has the usual features	3
and is easy to interpret.	3
In sum, this is a very nice little TV for an excellent price.	6

B007PXV310-0004
I received a broken TV.	5
It was missing the screw for it's stand	5
and it had 3 dead pixels.	4
The batteries for the remote were still good.	5
That's a plus.	5
Also, the sound on this thing is terrible.	8
Worse than the cheapest laptop speakers...	8
Not happy with this purchase.	5

B007PXV310-0012
I bought this	5
because I was looking for a new TV for an extra bedroom.	5
A 32 inch LCD 1080 120 Hz for under $ 240. 00,	6
said why not.	5
Right out the box, the TV had green color and lines through the screen.	4
I was hoping	5
it was just a setting but come to find out its a defect	5
and had to send it back.	5
Once the new TV came,	5
the problem was gone.	5
The picture is nice and clear but the sound is horrible.	8 4
I highly recommend having a sound system for this TV.	5

B007PXV310-0018
The picture is great.	4
You can't go wrong with LCD.	5
The 32 '' screen is very suitable for your average living room or a bedroom.	7
This can also be swapped out for your computer monitor.	1
Most people will	5
(I expect)	5
use external sound.	5
The built-in speakers really don't sound very good	8
-- I think	5
that's par for the course though,	5
so it's not a complaint.	5
A couple things	5
to note :	5
start up	5
takes about 10 seconds and channel changes take about 4 seconds.	5
This unit also puts out some heat in back.	5
This unit is quite easy to use	3
and to set up.	3
This is very affordable for a HDTV.	5
We enjoy having this TV.	5

B007PXV310-0023
Overall a very good tv with great picture quality.	4
The sound is the only issue.	8
It is not very full with good treble or bass.	8
However,	5
when you connect it to a sound system all is well.	5
A good value priced tv.	6

B007PXV310-0027
The TV in my office just died a few days ago.	5
After searching on line and stores,	5
I came across this TV.	5
It is a great value.	6
The pictures is clear,	4
sharp and the colors are vibrant.	4
You definitely can't beat the price!	6
I highly recommend this TV.	5

B0093YV4R2-0000
I received the TV yesterday.	5
I expected to have minor issues with back light bleeding	5
as others have reported,	5
but it was much worse	5
than I expected.	5
The bleeding on the right side of screen extended vertically almost entirely from the bottom corner to top corner and then out about 5 inches from right to left along the top and bottom.	4
Also, there was a large blue area in the middle of the screen	5
that was very visible	5
when the screen was black,	5
and there was a dead pixel in the upper right quadrant of the screen.	4
I'd say	5
this thing is defective.	5
Getting a refund	5
and getting something else.	5

B0093YV4R2-0008
Quit	5
working after 9 + months.	5
Worked fine.	5
Great Picture.	4
Great Sound.	8
I thought	5
I was happy	5
but I was expecting the TV	5
to last 3-4 years not 9 months...	5
Guess I was wrong!	5

B0093YV4R2-0010
I was really excited	5
when I saw this for $ 350.	5
I've wanted an LED TV for a while	5
and could finally afford one.	5
Performance is just OK. pix-elates during bright flashes on the screen.	4
Also color washes out at greater than 30 degree angle, can still see picture just looks like its in a bright fog.	4
Head on though the picture quality is excellent,	4
and the features are pretty good.	5
One thing	5
that I was really disappointed in is	5
that I have a wii for the wife and kids	1
and this does not have the standard coax input	1
you need the HD connectors.	1
From what I've seen with those	5
it's hit	5
and miss on quality and picture	5
so I'm hoping the one	5
I've ordered	5
will be good.	5
All in all I think	5
it is well worth the price,	6
but definitely not the best out there.	5
If I would've had more to spend	5
I might have tried the TCL 48 " LED or gotten another Vizio.	5

B0093YV4R2-0018
Easy set up.	3
Clear picture,	4
However sound is very tinny had to hook up a speaker system.	8
Side mounted	5
inputs made it easy.	1
All in all Good deal for the price!	6

B0093YV4R2-0029
I was searching for an easy to use HDTV for my 90 year-old grandmother	5
and I am happy	5
I went with this RCA 42-inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV.	5
Setup was very easy and the remote is simple to use.	3
Does come with two HDMI, PC, USB port and AV inputs for individuals	1
who wish to connect more components and devices.	1
Displays beautiful vivid colors	4
that are crisp and vibrant.	4
Sound quality is produced from two 8 watt speakers that sound clear and not muffled.	8
Ultra thin and weighs less than 40 pounds.	7
The swivel stand is an added bonus	5
since must table	5
top stands do not move.	5
Great value for the money and highly recommend it.	6

B009SJNTIY-0004
After having this TV for just over a year,	5
white spots are	4
starting to show up all over the TV.	4
For that much money it's ridiculous	6
that the TV is already going bad.	6
Trying to see	5
if this TV was part of a recall,	5
but since we've had it 14 months - seems	5
like we are out our money.	5
Don't waste your money.	6

B009SJNTIY-0021
The TV quality is pretty solid for the price	6
but within 2 months one of the lcd back lights failed.	4
I called Vizio	2
who said	2
they would send out a " TV	2
we can't call new " to me as a replacement.	2
This means I spent full price on a used TV.	2 6
Shipping was supposed to come a week later	2
but they canceled.	2
They rescheduled another week and by that time the entire TV went black.	2 4
So for a week I now have to sit with no TV	2
that I paid $ 1500 waiting for them	2 6
to bring my used TV	2 6
that I still paid $ 1500 for.	2 6
Apparently the backlight going out is a pretty common problem.	4
Easy to find on the internet.	5
In hindsight... size isn't everything.	7
I should have purchased a better brand.	5

B009SJNTIY-0027
Picture quality is OK but not fantastic.	4
My 5 year old Panasonic 50 inch plasma has a better picture	4
but this is not bad.	4
What is disappointing is the viewing angle.	4
If you are not looking straight on at the TV,	4
it appears washed out.	4
Perhaps I just need to tune it better	5
but I think	5
my other Vizio LEDs have a better picture overall.	4
You will also need a good source of video	5
as because it is a 70 inch,	5
any imperfections are seen easily.	5
Even while watching basketball games,	5
you can see	5
when different cameras are used.	5
The White Glove service was not there either.	2
Pilot delivered it	2
and only came with one person	2
despite the fact	2
that the box clearly says	2
that it requires two people.	2
My 100lb wife had to help him carry it downstairs.	2
This is still a good value for the money	6
but had expected better.	5

Wonderful television picture, size and quality are all excellent.	4 7
The price was excellent	6
and I highly recommend this television to anyone	5
who is looking for a big screen smart tv for a good price.	7 6
The only reason	5
I couldn't rate it	5
a full 5 stars is	5
because the sound quality is good but not great i.e.	8
the bass is marginal at best.	8

I absolutely love this TV.	5
Excellent picture quality and sound.	8 4
The best feature is the ease of the applications.	0 3
The user interface is very user friendly	0 3
and everything is easily accessible.	0 3
The remote makes	3
using this TV very easy.	3
We also purchased a high end 70 " Sony the same day we purchased this TV.	5
The Vizio was by far a better TV.	5
I wish	5
we had purchased 2.	5
Delivery was excellent and easy.	2
The delivery people checked the TV	2
before leaving.	2
This is my favorite TV ever.	5

I bought the TV at Fry's after salesperson assured	5
me headphones would work with this TV	5
however after buying two different sets of headphones,	5
I realized its not the headphones but the audio outputs on the TV	1
that are not functioning.	1
Got online for website	2
shown on owners manual	5
shown tclusa.com	2
and it has apparently been shut down	2
(only has ads for amazon TVs	5
and not support or contact numbers).	2
I would not recommend this company	2
because they have no reliable support system in the US.	2
Frustrating!	5

I own the last model.	5
Within a year the HDMI ports stopped working	1
and the TV would go black for about three to five seconds every few minutes.	4
It provided a stable but lower quality resolution picture with the composite cables.	4
Other people have also reported the problem.	5
TCL phone reps refused to let me bring it to a service center	2
located in a city 40 miles from my house	5
(I planned to drive)	5
and insisted	2
I mail it to them	2
and pay an additional $ 50 shipping charge.	2
I decided not to bother fixing it	5
since it is just a cheapo kitchen TV.	5
The sound quality is okay for the price.	8
Never did find a code	5
which worked the TV through my Comcast remote.	5

B00BP5N498-0017
I bought this in a rush	5
because my previous TV	5
(a Samsung 42 " plasma) had	5
gone out	5
and I wanted to get a replacement very quickly.	5
In retrospect, I wish	5
I'd given myself more time and not bought the first thing	5
that jumped out at me.	5
It's not that it's a bad TV,	5
it's just not great either.	5
It feels smaller than 40 "	7
when I 'm	5
watching it,	5
the picture is decent but not quite as nice as the Samsung	4
it replaced.	4
It has all of the inputs	1
I hoped for	1
(3 HDMI	1
being important to me).	5
But at the end of the day, it's just an okay tv in my opinion.	5
For the price, it was a pretty solid option.	6
That said,	5
a big part of me wishes	5
I 'd	5
spent a bit more	5
and gotten something better.	5

B00BP5N498-0033
So far so good.	5
Great picture quality and sound.	8 4
I was a bit nervous	5
about purchasing a brand I am unfamiliar with	5
but if works like a tv should.	5
It took effort	3
to get it connected to verizon	3
and I still have to use the tv	3
remote to turn the tv on and off	3
which is why I gave it 4 stars.	5
Its also way bigger than anticipated but that was me not getting how big a 40 in tv actually is.	7

B00BP5N498-0056
Great for the price.	6
I just need it for my bedroom,	5
so basic TV work fine.	5
Picture is acceptable and sound	8 4
is above average.	8
I use it for Chromecast,	5
outcome is great.	5
If you budget is under $ 300 for 40 ' TV, then this probably you best choice.	6
I owned a Samsung TV.	5
It is definitely better than TCL,	5
but it costs much more.	5
Again,	5
If you are looking for a basic TV	5
(not smart TV),	5
I recommend it.	5
