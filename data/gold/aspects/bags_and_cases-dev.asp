The photo online and on the card	4
attached to the case shows foam.	4
Where is it?	4
I don't have any foam included.	4
There is NO way this thin! thin! thin! case would protect a pencil let alone a heavy laptop.	6
Don't waste your money.	4
Mine goes back tomorrow!	4

B0000A2QBX-0004
I use this case on a daily basis	4
and have used it for about five months and by then both strap attachments	2 7
and the handle broke	2 7
and I am already having to look for a new case.	4
If you are going to use this daily buy something that	7
is of better quality.	7
It looks nice	3
and is not very bulky	4
but will brake due to poor quality.	7

B0000A2QBX-0014
I really liked this bag.	4
It has room for power cables and a few other small things.	0
I had it for over a year	4
but only used it occasionally.	4
Unfortunately over the holidays the hand strap broke.	2 7
Great buy, just be careful with the straps.	2 7

B0000A2QBX-0023
I bought this case at the recomendation of a friend.	4
The size of the case is great,	8
it even fits under te seat on smaller airplanes.	8
I do not need a lot of space for extras,	8 0
so this is the perfect size.	8
The padding is good	4
and it is quite stylish. there is just enough size for a mouse, power cord, a fre CD's and a cell phone.	8 3
I love the styling and details,	3
it is well thought out.	4
There is although one drawback.	4
My machine is just shy of the maximum size	4
allowed by th specs.	4
There is a pouch inside for the computer,	8
and it is a tight fit	8
to put it in.	4
This is a definite drawback,	4
but given the opportunity I would buy the same one again.	4

B0000A2QBX-0038
I love this bag	4
and I am so glad	4
that I ordered it.	4
I shopped around	4
for a few weeks and nothing is as good as this.	4
The quality of the bag is outstanding.	7
The design is perfect to fit the laptop, batteries, pens, paperwork, etc..	0
The padding inside really keeps the laptop secure.	6
Other laptop bags	4
that I saw	4
were either bulky or super expensive.	4
The price on Amazon is great	5
however I would have definately paid more	4
given what is out there currently.	4
If you are considering this product	4
look no further	4
because this is what you have	4
been looking for!	4

B0009JR5K0-0000
From the picture on Amazon this product appeared to be of good quality.	7
Four	7
(4) weeks	7
after we purchased the item some of the stripping at the bottom of the bag	7
peeled off.	7
I was unable to return the item	1
because I had it just over the four weeks.	1
I decided to keep the product and about 3 weeks from that date, one	4
(1) of the handles broke on the item	2 7
and left me with just the one handle	2 7
to lift the item with.	2
Five	7
(5) months later the last handle finally broke off the product.	2 7
I used this bag solely for the purpose	4
of carrying my laptop	4
and supplies.	4
I am very disappointed in the quality of item	7
given the amount of money requested.	5

B0009JR5K0-0005
BOTH handles on this case have broken.	2 7
The plastic handles can not stand up to normal wear	2 7
and tear.	2 7
The case was not too bad,	4
but now it is useless.	4
I will be returning it to Kensington.	4

B0009JR5K0-0008
The basic concept and design would rate five stars if execution were not flawed.	4
The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style.	7 3
In the course of just one trip to Asia, have already had one pull come off.	7
The bag could also use a shoulder strap for those inevitable situations	2
(climbing stairs	4
and negotiating narrow aisles)	4
when you can't roll the thing.	4

B0009JR5K0-0017
The Kensington laptop case has good protection for a laptop.	6
There is sufficient space	4
to carry laptop accessories and a daytimer, folders, a jacket or raincoat, noise reduction earphones and munchies for the road.	8 0
I'm pleased with it	4
and recommend it for road warriors	4
who travel frequently,	4
as I do.	4
The only drawback is having to leave it plane-side for small planes.	4

B0009JR5K0-0026
This bag is incredible	4
if you have a 17 inch laptop.	8
It's so hard	4
to find a good bag	8
that'll fit my enormous laptop,	8
and this one more than fits the bill.	8
It has a really comfortable handle	2
if you need	4
to carry it,	4
and has so many hidden pockets	0
and places to put things.	0
I love it,	4
and can't say enough about it.	4
The quality is also excellent.	7
I highly recommend getting one.	4
It's worth the price.	5

B000VB7EFW-0002
I was very disappointed with this backpack.	4
It says	4
it fits a 17inch notebook,	8
however it did not.	8
It is always a hassle	1
to return Christmas gifts -	1
not that it was difficult through Amazon	1
(very easy and hassle free) -	1
just the hassle	4
of packing up	4
and going to the post office.	4

B000VB7EFW-0007
We bought	4
this as a good price. that is all	5
I can say.	4
The laptop	8
we have	8
doesn't fit in it.	8
And	4
after using the pack for less than a month,	4
it is ripping out already.	7
Definatly would not purchase again	4
and would not recomend.	4

B000VB7EFW-0010
This is a very well made bag, nice construction, lots of pockets.	7 0
The pocket for the media player is on the inside of the bag	0
and there's a connector there as well with the wire running down through the bag strap to a connector outside of the bag for you	0
to use with your headphones with.	0
The bad thing about this bag is	8
that it barely fits my xps m1710	8
and my HP Pavilion DV7-3080US cant fit at all,	8
which is a big disappointment.	8

B000VB7EFW-0020
I love this backpack.	4
The quality is excellent	7
and I love all the pockets and compartments.	0
I have a 15. 4 '' widescreen laptop	4
and it fits great.	8
However,	4
because my laptop is 6. 4lbs and the backpack is 6lbs,	4
the weight can add up fast.	4
I have a lot of textbooks for school and the weight of everything usually averages 40lbs.	4
Granted,	4
the bag holds it all very well with room to spare	4
and it is very durable.	7
I bought the bag a couple years ago	3
and it still looks brand new.	3
I've also used the bag for weekend camping	4
(minus the laptop)	4
and can fit all my clothes	8
and whatnot in it --	8
I love	8
how much	8
stuff it can hold.	8
Also,	4
once I have the bag on my back,	4
the straps are very comfortable.	2
It's just not the lightest backpack	4
to swing on your shoulder	4
and run out the door.	4

B000VB7EFW-0028
I purchased this bag for my husband.	4
He is a supervisor	4
and carries his laptop everywhere.	4
He LOVES this bag	4
and can't beleive the price	5
we were able to get it for on Amazon.com.	4
We have seen this same bag out in the stores for close to $ 100.	5
It is very well made	7
and protects everything inside.	6
If you are even	4
thinking about buying this bag -	4
GET IT!	4

B00307F8PW-0000
It looks good,	3
BUT the smell is really bad.	7
After I read the tag saying :	4
this item uses the chemical	7
that may cause cancer, birth defect, and reproductive harm!	7
I shoveled it into the box	4
and return it immediately!	4

B00307F8PW-0004
This bag is very padded,	6
has lots of compartments and space, BUT,	8 0
it's too HEAVY.	4
Also the straps on this bag are so firm	2
that they don't bend easily.	2
This causes my shoulders to hurt after only a few minutes.	2
I stopped using it.	4
Will have to search for something better.	4

B00307F8PW-0007
I bought this bag for my 17 inch laptop..	4
Fits perfectly!	8
I have an extended battery on my laptop	4
and this bag can fit my laptop, the charger, a few notebooks, pencils, pens, and few other small items.	8
It definetly does its job well.	4
It is a nice bag	4
my only thing is	4
that on the edges it	7
starting to peel a bit.. perhaps Its	7
from rubbing	4
on my jeans or just getting	4
thrown around a bit..	4
I take good care of my stuff..	4
Its better than nothing.	4
For the price its good..	5
It doesnt compare to a nice leather bag..	4
The price also doesnt compare to that of a leather bag..	5
Overall, its a great bag.	4
Does what its supposed to do.	4
Sender sent quickly.. :)	4

B00307F8PW-0021
Bought this as my back up bag b/c	4
I am tough on my bags.	4
I bought to use for my court briefcase	4
to bring legal sized files in.	4
Seems very durable and a good size.	8 7
Haven't used it much yet though but I am happy with it so far!	4

B00307F8PW-0037
I am very picky about bags, purses, etc..	4
And a bag	4
for carrying my macbook pro in is not something	4
to be taken lightly :)	4
After reading very helpful reviews on this I decided to give it a try and so glad	4
I did.	4
I love the material on the outside	7
and it's very spacious for my 15 '' laptop and other books, folders for school.	8
The ONLY complaint is	4
that I wish	0
it had small pockets on the outside for my phone, wallet, keys instead of one huge pocket	0
where I find myself digging for those things.	4
But that is just me complaining,	4
because this is a really great buy.	4

B0038KLD50-0001
I started using this bag in July	4
to carry my laptop to and from work.	4
Three months later and the strap ripped.	2 7
I only carry the laptop and a few papers,	4
I can't understand how a laptop bag could be so cheaply made.	7
It's a good thing	6
that it has good padding, otherwise,	6
it would've damaged the computer.	6
Very dissappointed.	4
I've contacted Case Logic,	4
we'll see what happens.	4

B0038KLD50-0011
The case looks lovely,	3
and has lots of nice pockets.	0
But, the first case	4
that I rec	4
'd had a defective zipper.	7
No problem getting it returned	1
and replaced.	1
The replacement case appeared fine -	4
until I used it for travel the first time.	4
The pad	4
that slips over the straps	4
to provide comfort	4
when carrying the case	4
started coming apart,	7
and when the fraying stops,	4
the pad will fall off.	7
An additional note on the padded shoulder strap : The buckle on the ` adjustable shoulder strap ' does not actually fit through that shoulder pad,	2
so the strap can never be adjusted to anything other than short or shorter length	2
if you want to use that padding.	2
If you actually want it to go over-the-shoulder	4
and across your body like a true messenger,	4
you can't adjust the strap	2
to be long enough	2
(unless you don't want that pad to be on your shoulder - ouch).	4
This was true of both cases,	4
so it is simply bad design.	4

B0038KLD50-0014
The bag is nice	4
and seems well made.	7
My only complaint is	4
that the shoulder strap is not on a metal swivel.	2
Sooner or later the plastic connector or the strap is going to break from wear.	2 7

B0038KLD50-0024
I'm pretty pleased with this messenger bag.	4
It has loads of space	8
since I only own a 10 '' netbook.	4
I'm not sure how well this would accommodate a larger laptop,	8
but for my purposes, I've got lots of room	8
to spare for other goodies	8
and that's the biggest reason	4
I like it.	4
As far as internal padding, it's a bit weak for my taste.	6
I place my netbook inside a padded sleeve	4
before placing it into this bag.	4
I like a little more protection for my computer	6
than what is in this bag.	6
If I didn't already have a padded sleeve,	4
I'd probably be disappointed with this bag.	4
I'm also not sure how durable this material is.	7
I've been using this bag daily for well over a month now and thus far,	7
it has held up quite well,	7
but something tells	4
me this is a 1-3 year use bag and not a 5-10 year bag,	7
but then again, it all depends on your usage of it	4
and whether or not you're very hard on it.	4
For my purposes and use of the bag, I am pleased.	4
I'm using it every day.	4

B0038KLD50-0045
This is really nice case.	4
You can access the laptop	4
without needing to open the flap	0
and the laptop comes out easily.	4
I've had this for about 6 months	7
it has no signs of wear.	7
It is very durable.	7
It also has a large amount of padding, probably about 1/2 ''.	6
The flap has three pockets ; one on the outside and two on the inside.	0
I have no problems	0
fitting a mouse, mouse pad, charger, and headset inside it.	0
However, it is too small	8
to fit a keyboard.	8
One review complains about the flap	4
being held in place with magnets.	4
This is not true.	4
Mine is attached with velcro.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0000
i swapped my mac for a smaller dell laptop xps,	4
so i needed a smaller case/sleeve. the design on the site looked cute. however,	3
it turned out about the same size	8
as my higher end marc jacobs sleeve	8
(which i love,	4
but didn't need all the space)	8
and the quality of this case is terrible,	7
like made in china,	7
bought in chinatown terrible. i	7
suppose you get what you pay for : (	5

B003BWYJ4C-0004
It's pretty in the picture,	3
but I don't care for it much in person.	3
It's poor quality	7
and I don't trust my laptop	6
to be protected in it.	6
A few months after I bought this	4
I found an amazing brand name laptop case for half this price.	4
Too bad it's too late	4
to return this one,	4
but I guess	4
I'll just keep it in my closet.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0006
It's really good looking	3
and I feel	6
like it protects my laptop well	6
but sometimes the zipper gets stuck.	7
I have really push my macbook in.	8
I have a speck hard cover on my laptop,	4
which may be the reason why,	4
but I saw some other reviews with the same issue.	4
It does fit with a case on it though, you just have to make sure	8
it's really in there.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0013
If all you need to do	4
is protect your MacBook,	6
this stylish bag is well-constructed and just the thing.	6 7 3
Wish it had an outer pocket	0
to carry the power cord.	0

B003BWYJ4C-0020
I purchased this case for my wife for her new MBAir	4
and she loves it!	4
The case arrived promptly,	1
it is the correct size,	8
and works	4
as advertised.	4
As I have never purchased a laptop case before,	4
I was a bit surprised	4
how thin it was.	3
It doesn't add much bulk to the super-thin MBAir	8
and yet provides enough protection during normal use.	6
It fits very nicely in my wife's purse	8
and looks great!	3

B0064RDIWU-0003
The color was great --	3
as expected,	4
the fit was not.	8
The case did not line up with the ports	8
and it did not clip into place --	8
not even with persuasion!	8
I would not recommend this product.	4

B0064RDIWU-0017
I like the case overall and I really like the color,	3
but what made me only give it 2 stars was the rubber bottoms.	7 3
They were a cheap white material	7
and got messy.	7
I tried	4
pulling them off	4
to put my own on at it was kind of hard to do.	4

B0064RDIWU-0028
Color is awesome!	3
Top cover fit perfect.	8
Bottom was a great fit on the back	8
but failed to latch on at the front.	8
The keyboard cover was great but after having it a few months	4
the cover is not sealing anymore.	8
The corners on the top and bottom are beginning to crack.	7
The computer does not move all that much	4
so I can't think of a reason	7
why it would begin to crack.	7

B0064RDIWU-0041
Being paranoid about scratching or spilling something on my computer,	4
I decided to buy a hard case.	4
I love the color	3
and it was really easy to put on.	8
The only concern	4
that I really had was	4
that since I now had the case on my computer would still fit into the sleeve	4
that I had	4
bought to carry it around in,	4
and yes it still does	4
even though it is a little snug.	4
The only reason	4
why it didn't get five stars	4
is	4
because the case came with a couple of scratches,	7
but that was not a problem for me.	4

B0064RDIWU-0085
So, I was very skeptical about a case in general.	4
I wanted lime green,	3
and this is actually lime green...	3
It feels nice and rubbery	7 3
(not yucky plastic like	4
some covers).	4
Not recommended for greasy fingers,	4
but I do	4
it anyways	4
and there aren't that many marks.	4
It's a perfect fit	8
(I'm just bad at taking off the top ;	8
though I have taken it off multiple times.)	8
You can see the apple logo,	4
and it doesn't scratch your computer. it doesn't add too much bulk,	8 3
but it's definitely adds a little more weight	4

B0083LOW7A-0000
Poor quality.	7
The " quilted	7 3
" pattern had large creases and wrinkles.	7 3
The handles felt cheap	2
and the white part on the bottom had black marks on it.	7 3
Then there was the overpowering chemical smell	7
that was nauseating.	7
It was a mix of chemical and mothballs.	7
I would have returned this bag	4
simply because of the smell	4
but the fact	4
it was in poor condition	7
was really annoying.	7
I would not recommend this bag.	4

B0083LOW7A-0006
My handle has already started to rip.	2 7
It looks similar to a lap top bag not a purse	3
like I was hoping.	4
Has good protection on the inside for the lap top	6
I just thought	4
there would be more pockets as well as not looking so cheap.	3 0
Definitely would not pay more than ten bucks for this if that.	5

B0083LOW7A-0008
Looks very good, very professional, fashionable.	3
Material is way to cheap	7
and it won't last to much.	7
I already have a lot of problems with it.	4
Inside is awesome for your laptop.	8
I won't recommend it if you will use it everyday or for traveling.	4

B0083LOW7A-0020
I recently purchased my first mac for college	4
and I was so excited to get a new bag	4
to hold it.	4
When I saw this bag	4
I knew	4
it would be perfect	4
and it is!	4
It has two pockets, one for the laptop itself and then one for other things such as folders or a planner.	0
I used this bag for classes	4
and attached the shoulder strap.	2
But after about a month of use the loops	2 7
that I hooked the shoulder strap to	2 7
started to tear.	2 7
I unfortunately had to stop using it as a class bag	4
but it still works great	4
if I am going out to study	4
and I just need to bring my laptop and a notebook.	4
The hand straps have not ripped or torn so	2
really I think	4
the problem was	4
that I put too much weight in the bag.	4
I still use it quite often and I would highly recommend this item.	4
It is wonderful.	4
It looks great	3
and overall it functions perfectly!	4

B0083LOW7A-0071
Love the bag, protects my lap top perfectly!	6
The color ir so pretty,	3
matches my laptop's pink case, pink speakers and pink keyboard cover < 3	3
also my pink kindle case :D wich	8 3
this bag is big enough to carry it as well.	8
It is very well built,	7
the material has good quality	7
and the little bag for the laptop cables is big enough	8 0
to keep safe my macbook cables, some adapters, remote control and the pink strap	8 2 0
that comes with this bag.	2
Also it has cellphone and pens compartments	0
and it has as much space	0
to save documents, kindle in case, glasses case, the little white bag, my speakers, some CDs and my wallet,	0
without deforming or looking stuffed.	0
I definitely recommend this bag!!!	4

B0085B772A-0001
I bought this case	4
based on the good reviews and the cheap price.	5
My wife and I have to 13. 3 ' macbooks and I had the $ 40 incase sleeve	4
and I got a $ 25 case logic case for my wife.	4
Both of those were made out of noticeably thicker material than this one.	7
While this case fit fine	8
and looked fine,	3
I could tell right away	4
that the material was thinner, almost paper-thin.	7
I just would feel nervous putting my laptop in one of these,	4
you might as well not have a case at all.	4
I returned it	4
and opted for the $ 25 case logic case.	4
I think	4
it's worth the extra $ 10.	5

B0085B772A-0009
Description says	4
it will fit 13. 3 inch ultrabooks,	8
but this is false.	8
Do not buy for a 13. 3 inch ultrabook.	4
My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 did not fit in it.	8
Good product design,	3
but poor description.	4

B0085B772A-0011
I have a new 13 ''	4
Macbook Air	4
and was looking for a horizontally-oriented sleeve	4
to put in another bag.	4
The price on this was good	5
and the feel is generally OK,	7
but I have a couple of complaints.	4
First, the sleeve is a bit too big for the Macbook Air.	8
There's still a lot of empty space	8
when the computer is in the sleeve.	4
Second, the sleeve isn't really that protective.	6
The material is quite thin.	7
I wouldn't count on any sort of drop protection	6
if you happen to drop your computer	6
while it's in this sleeve.	6
Overall, can't complain too much	4
but I'm on the lookout for other sleeves.	4

B0085B772A-0040
Bought this item for the Lenovo	4
(13 '') Yoga laptop.	4
Although you have to stretch the sleeve a bit around the edge of the laptop	8
to zip it close,	8
the product is everything	4
I expected.	4
The side pocket adds a nice touch.	0
Cushioning/padding is adequate.	6 7
Overall, great product for a reasonable price.	5

B0085B772A-0057
This bag is very well-made.	7
When I ordered it,	4
I didn't realize	4
that it even has handles hidden at the top!	2
It's a little bit	8
bigger than my 13. 3 inch Macbook Pro	8
(even after I put on a hard shell)	4
;	4
so if you are looking for a snug fit,	8
this might not be your favorite.	8
But it works for me.	4
I especially like the front pocket.	0
It would be so convenient for the charger and everything else	0
(e.g., a mouse).	4

B009PJ2CQC-0001
I loved this case,	4
it was so inexpensive	5
and my macbook air fit perfectly in it.	8
Unfortunately after regular use, i.e.	4
I used	4
it Monday-Thursday in Law School,	4
it already has ripped at an edge.	7
I am so careful with my laptop	4
so I'm assuming	4
this is from poor quality of the case.	7
But you do get	4
what you pay for.	4
I guess	4
I just thought	4
it would last me at least a semester not just 1 month!	4

B009PJ2CQC-0005
I know	4
this wasn't an overly expensive item,	5
but at the same time, it should work for what it is advertised.	4
I purchased this case for a 13 in macbook air,	8
and it doesn't even begin to fit.	8
I can not get the laptop even half way into this case.	8
I read many reviews prior to actually ordering	4
that indicated quite clearly	4
they had also used it for a 13 in macbook air.	4
I would be perfectly content if only it actually covered the item	4
for which it was purchased.	4
I does appear	4
as though it would fulfill my needs for a lightweight cover	4
to allow me to easily store my laptop around the house	4
without worrying about the stray scratches and scuffs.	4
IF ONLY IT WOULD FIT!!	8

B009PJ2CQC-0016
An awesome lil stylish bag	3
that fits a Macbook Air or any other	8
that's slightly slightly thicker	8
will fit perfectly.	8
It looked better in the picture,	3
but it was still good.	3
I bought	4
as a gift and my friend was really pleased	4
so it worked out.	4

B009PJ2CQC-0021
This case is really beautiful	3
and fits my computer snug.	8
Fashionable and sleek I am pretty happy with it.	3
The quality isn't the best	7
and I have a little tear in from commuting so much with it,	7
but nothing that will stop me from using it.	4
Great product for the price.	5

B009PJ2CQC-0033
I purchased this to keep dust and scratches away from my new Sony Vaio Pro 13 ultrabook.	4
It fits beautifully	8
and looks great.	3
Product quality is also good.	7
No issues with closure on the Vaio,	4
regardless of direction of insertion, though it is easier	4
to pull it out	4
if you put the spine in first.	4
Recommend the vendor and the product.	4
