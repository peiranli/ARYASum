B000GUDPDI-0002
This product does not keep a charge very long and cuts off continually.	0 2
The earpiece is very uncomfortable.	1
Even at such a cheap price,	7
it was not a good investment.	6
I only used it for a couple of days	6
and gave up.	6
Save your money	6
and buy a better brand.	6

B000GUDPDI-0006
Well, I went ahead	6
and bought this at the reduced price.	6
It was good at first and	6
then other people were having problems	8
hearing me	8
and I was misunderstood because of this headset.	8
Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls	6
and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me.	6
I am returning this product	6
because it is just not worth it to me	6
if the other person can not hear me properly.	8
I do like the design of it and the fact	5
that you get to choose	1
how you place it in your ear.	1
I don't care about it otherwise.	6

B000GUDPDI-0011
No problem setting the unit up with my Moto phone.	2
But nobody could hear me	8
when I used the headset.	8
Maybe I'm expecting too much,	6
since this is my first try at a Bluetooth headset,	6
but IMO it's useless.	6

B000GUDPDI-0018
This is my first bluetooth headset.	6
I must say	6
it works great with my Motorola V360 cell phone.	6
I get good sound quality,	8
and people can hear me very clearly.	8
Judging from all the other reviews say,	6
I must be one of the lucky ones	6
that has an ear	6
made for this headset.	6
It fits great in my ear,	1
and the over the ear piece is just right for me.	1
I can wear it around for an extended period of time	1
and it's not uncomfortable.	1
Battery life seems to be very good on it as well.	0
I don't know	6
why you'd pay $ 50 + for a headset	7
when this one works so well for so much less.	7

B000GUDPDI-0026
For the money, this is a great little addition to your bluetooth enhancement on your cell phone.	7
Beats a wired ear plug.	6
Just follow the instructions and off you go.	6
Make sure	6
you pair up the two as instructed for Bluetooth 1. 2.	2
Why pay 60 bucks or more for one	7
when you can get this for 20?	7
This is a good product so far.	6

B0017KXLC6-0003
The item is well made,	3
the fit is	1
c omfortable but the sound quality is extremely poor, anytime I received a incoming call	8 1
the party on the other end had great difficulity	8
hearing me.	8
I was extremely dissapointed with this motorrola headset	6
after owning several in the past.	6

B0017KXLC6-0024
I owned one of these headsets for five years	6
and it was fantastic!	6
Never had problems	6
keeping the charge,	0
always worked,	6
always warned me	0
when it was about to lose its charge.	0
It finally wore out like all electronics do	3
so I purchased a new one.	6
This one is terrible.	6
It won't always link with the phone.	2
People complain	8
that they can't hear me.	8
It doesn't warn me	0
when it's about to lose its charge,	0
just shuts off.	0
I would not recommend this headset to anyone.	6

B0017KXLC6-0031
Seller service is excellent!	6
Speedy delivery.	6
I would buy from them again.	6
Product :	6
It is decent for my BB-Tour.	6
Sound quality is selective.	8
Some days are better than others.	8
I have had lower numbered models	6
that work much better.	6
Fits the ear nicely.	1
Good for general driving usage.	6
If you are looking for something	6
to conduct business or you	6
need a high quality bluetooth.	6
Investigate other models.	6

B0017KXLC6-0044
This Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset is very light, compact	5
(fits in the smallest purse),	6
and comfortable.	1
I've had this product for a few weeks now	6
and I am very satisfied with its performance, in fact	6
it is so comfortable	1
that I forget	1
that I am wearing it.	1
The sound quality is good	8
and it works very well with my Motorola phone and its features.	2 4
I would recommend this product to anyone	6
who wants a headset	6
that works well	6
and is easy on your wallet.	7

B0017KXLC6-0050
I have owned my H700 for several years,	6
paired it with a Carbo unit	2
attached to a non bluetooh phone, a Razr, and a Blackberry with excelent results in every case.	2
I have left it alone in a drawer for several months at one point	6
(actuially `` lost ''	6
it for awhile)	6
and have been	6
using it on a daily basis with my Blackberry	6
and am still getting excelent connection results	2
including volume range and noise.	8
It has excellent recharge time and charge life.	0
It is so comfortable I frequently forget to take it off	1
(almost wore it into the shower once.)	6
I have been looking for an excuse	6
to buy a unit	6
that is less obvious on my ear	6
(I have very short hair)	6
so have not been treating the unit with great care.	6
I carry it in my pocket with my car keys	6
and recently managed to dislodge the chorme or silver trim on the boom with no damage to performance.	6

B001DDPN9G-0004
Wanted to share a short feedback : Tried	6
and returned this headset.	6
Wanted to have a stereo headset for use with phone and music.	6
Here are the issues	6
I have with it :	6
- In headset mode only sound only comes on one ear	8
(in the manual	6
they state	6
that this is like this with all stereo headset	6
to avoid microphone feedback,	6
but this is not true.	6
The Moto S9-HD has sound on both ears even in headset mode).	6
- The range is really poor.	2
They say	2
it is 2 ft,	2
but with my laptop is was even less.	2
Again other headsets don't have that problem.	6
- The design of the ear pieces did not fit my ear anatomy very well.	1
I really tried for some time	1
but couldn't get it to be satisfactory.	1
- I had no clear audio in headset mode even close to the phone.	8
May have been an issue with my particular unit.	6
Got a S9-HD	6
after I returned this	6
and it is much nicer!!	6

B001DDPN9G-0022
Fantastic sound, great fit and a simple practicle set up.	8 1 4
HOWEVER headset looses connection	2
when phone is in my pocket	2
and once the connection is lost recconection	2
is slow if at all.	2
I tried two sets with the same result.	6
Despite the great sound and function	8
this product is useless without a strong connection.	2

B001DDPN9G-0025
Over all I like this product.	6
It is portable and sweat proof.	3
And with the additional purchase of some acustibud ear pieces the sounds is quite good.	8
Now I do have a few beefs.	6
Number one :	6
The should include a USB to wall charger.	0
Yeah I have one	6
that came with my iphone,	6
but this is the second accessory	6
that I bought	6
that was shipped without one.	6
So maybe it is standard practice, but still kind of lame.	0
Second : The stock rubber ear pieces are not very good.	1
Maybe it is the size of my ear canals,	1
but after reading a few of these I find	6
that I am not the only one	6
who thinks so.	6
Third : This isn't so much their fault	6
as I guess just something to expect with any bluetooth headset,	6
but my iphone 3GS's battery barely loses any juice	6
when I am using plugin headphones to listen to music,	6
but using these bluetooth headphones eats up about 10 % of my battery for every hour	0
I run.	6
Plugins uses maybe 1-2 % Not the end of the world, but something	0
to be aware of.	6
If it weren't for beefs number one and two,	6
I would give this product a 4. 5.	6

B001DDPN9G-0035
I am very pleased with this set of bluetooth headphones in general.	6
Strengths : Sweat and water resistant, lighter	1 3
than you would think, seem to disappear	1
after wearing them for a couple of minutes, good volume, ride unnoticed	8 1
when running,	1
lifting weights,	6
doing chores, biking	6
(with a helmet),	6
etc..	6
Weaknesses :	6
had to buy acoustibuds	6
to get them to fit properly,	1
the charger is large.	0
This latter point is both good and bad -	6
they could not put a mini USB port directly on the headphones	6
because they would not be sealed against sweat and rain.	6
But, the charger	0
that they decided on	0
is a nice stand, but large for traveling.	0
The ultimate question is	6
whether I would buy them again	6
if something happened to my set -	6
answer is yes.	6

B001DDPN9G-0052
This is an awesome product	6
IF you require SWEAT PROOF Bluetooth stereo.	2 3
- Small form factor enables more activities-Tiny rubberized buttons keep moisture out-Good sound qualityIf	8 4 3
you don't need sweat proof Bluetooth -	6
DO NOT buy this unit.	6
You'll be disappointed b/c :	6
- it has small/tiny buttons -	4
the sound isn't as rich as other on ear Bluetooth -	8
it always takes a few minutes just to put it on &	4
adjust it to my earI hope	4
this helps...	6

B002LEVL56-0003
GOOD :	6
Setup was incredibly easy and painless ;	2
no codes needed.	6
Cheap price	7
(even though mine came free as an offer with my phone).	6
BAD :	6
The fit for this item is absolutely HORRIBLE for me.	1
It only comes with one size ear piece,	1
and it WILL NOT stay in my ear.	1
Reception might be good.	8
It might not.	8
I can't tell you,	6
since I can't hear anything	6
when it's hanging out of my ear.	6
I was going to use this as a spare in my car,	6
in case I forget my Jawbone,	6
but it isn't worth leaving in the car,	6
since I'll only be tempted to keep trying it,	6
only to result in pure and utter frustration.	6

B002LEVL56-0007
Like others, I've found	6
the multifunction is too sensitive.	4
Too easy to push	4
when adjusting volume.	6
On the other hand, it does seat in my ear better than most Bluetooth headsets.	1

B002LEVL56-0011
I am not a fan of these things	6
but needed one	6
for when I drive.	6
I am on my phone a lot for work.	6
Over all it fits nice, keeps a charge for a long time	0 1
and is cheap.	7
The downside,	6
people say	6
it sounds	8
like I am in a cave,	8
I just tell them	6
I am	6
and they are not invited, lol.	6
Several people at my office have these and all like them for the price and comfort.	7 1
Perhaps it is just mine	8
that does the cave noise either way	8
I do not care.	6
I hear fine, lol.	8

B002LEVL56-0017
This is a pretty good headset,	6
others say	6
they can hear me clearly,	8
and the sound is clear to me as well.	8
It has a plain look	5
which is a real plus for me,	5
I don't want to look like I'm wearing geeky jewelry.	6
The volume level in my ear is low even at the highest setting.	8
In the car I have	8
to roll the windows up	8
to hear the incoming call.	6
At home I have to go to a quiet room.	6
It paired up with my HTC Droid Incredible quickly.	2
I occasionally hear	2
it say `` Disconnected '' then `` Connected ''	2
but it has not dropped during a call.	2
I don't know	6
if you can get a better bt headset for twenty dollars.	6
I could not find the manual online	6
and the printed manual in the box is tiny.	6
I scanned it	6
so I could easily magnify it to a more readable size.	6

B002LEVL56-0031
I bought this item for my PS3 as a replacement for the headset	6
made by SONY.	6
It does	6
the job, no background noise is heard,	8
really crisp sound,	8
volume is great, really nice piece of equipment.	8
I recommend buying this headset instead of sony.	6
It does the job	6
and it does it well.	6
Charger is for wall connection	0
so your PS3 does not have to be ON for the headset	6
to be charged.	6
Is smaller that the SONY and more comfortable.	1
Easy to turn ON and OFF.	4
The headset is also Bluetooth 2. 1 technology instead of 2. 0	6
So thats another plus,	6
and the price is almost free.	7
Buy it,	6
use it	6
and enjoy it!!!	6

B002SUCYFO-0002
I bought it because of good reviews from others here.	6
In the first month it was good.	6
But lately, it started showing troubles.	3
Now, it is getting switched off	0 3
while talking even the headset is fully charged.	0 3
You can continue talking	6
if you turn it on again.	6
Also, this does not fit your ear.	1
There are 3 different sized earloop.	1
None of them is fit for me. 2 of them make my ear pain after 5 minutes of use.	1
I dont recommend this...	6

B002SUCYFO-0005
Not worth even $ 10, how can this be a Nokia product?	7
Shoddy, uncomfortable, crappy sound, won't stay in the ear.	8 1
Go for Jabra or Samsung, not Nokia,	6
when it comes to Bluetooth tooth earpieces.	6
I love my $ 25 Jabra.	6
I hate this thing.	6

B002SUCYFO-0008
I bought this Bluetooth to use with my Nokia cell phone.	6
This one has problems with sound.	8
The person on the other side usually has lot of issues with the sound quality.	8
Everything else is okay.	6
The earpiece is comfortable	1
and battery life is not bad either.	0

B002SUCYFO-0021
This works really well with my LG Env.	6
No problem pairing it up	2
or connecting.	2
Easy to turn on.	4
The only problem	6
which I have found with all headsets	6
I have used	6
is	6
they just won't pick up your voice as well as using the phone.	8

B002SUCYFO-0027
I'm very pleased with this headset.	6
It's comfortable	1
and can be customized for a secure fit, easy to connect, great battery life, clear communication and most importantly for me,	8 0 1 4 2
the volume is GREAT!	8
This is the first headset	6
I've had	6
where I have to turn the volume down.	8
Ant the price was very reasonable too.	7
The only drawback is the fact	6
that the power button is very small,	4
but once use to it,	6
it represents no issue to turn on or off.	6
I would highly recommend this item.	6

B005LL8IFM-0003
A complete waste of money.	6
The broke on the first usage,	3
Made of very cheap plastic	3
and very uncomfortable, in a few minutes	1
they hurts your ears.	1
Will never again buy anything from this brand.	6

B005LL8IFM-0009
I used the product during an indoor workout on the elliptical.	6
In the middle of the first workout the product quit working	3
and will no longer take a charge.	0
Upon review of the instructions,	6
it says	6
to keep the product away from moisture.	6
The fact of the matter...	6
the product can not tolerate ANY moisture	3
and it will likely crash and die	6
when it gets even a small amount of moisture.	6
If you plan to use this	6
when you might sweat...	6
make another selection.	6

B005LL8IFM-0016
This super great Bluetooth headset,	6
But for some reason this to big	1
to fit my ears.	1
And after 1 hour about,	1
it starting to hurt me.	1
So evrething about the Bluetooth is	6
super great the sound and the distance and the ability	8 2
to connect to my iPad 3rd gBottom line	2
I will not rocommend it to anyone	1
that want comfrtobole headset Bluetooth.	1

B005LL8IFM-0020
I previously went through three Motorola SD-9 and 10 bluetooth headphones.	6
The 9 version rusted out after seven months of intense sweating.	6
The two 10 are still in decent shape,	6
though the button on one no longer responds as reliably.	6
This product is not as sturdy or high quality in material as a Motorola,	3
but it pairs without a problem.	2
It is louder than my Motorolas,	8
and the buttons are quite accessible.	4
The hard plastic earpieces are not comfortable for long term wear.	1
Still for the money, I can not complain.	7
I primarily use it to listen to music or news	6
while working at the gym.	6

B005LL8IFM-0023
Very good sound.	8
Even a little bass.	8
Good battery life.	0
All the audio playing functions work well.	8
Used it quite a lot just to talk on the phone.	6
Sensitive microphone.	8
Not a complaint.	8
Just works best in a more quiet atmosphere.	8
But no one ever has a hard time	8
hearing me.	8
No one ever even realizes	6
I'm using headphones.	6
I'm impressed.	6
Great product.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0007
Nobody could hear me	8
when I tried using this.	8
Unbelievable amount of static.	8
I couldn't get it to unpair from the phone,	2
so I had to throw it out the window	6
to get out of range from it.	2

B005OTZJ2Q-0010
Cheap, plastic-y, and poor sound quality.	8 7 3
I bought this last year	6
and have never been satisfied.	6
Its made of the cheapest of materials	3
and the bluetooth has a hard time staying connected.	2
In addition, and more importantly the sound quality is absolutely terrible.	8
Next time I'll pass and so should you.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0014
I purchased this for about $ 32	7
and would say	6
it's very average.	6
When speaking to friends and family	6
they said	6
it sounded similar to my speaking on a speaker phone.	8
I used it mostly in my car on my commute to work.	6
I used it for about 15 phone calls	6
and would say	6
the other person could hear me well about 70 % of the time.	8
One phone call	8
the other person couldn't understand me at all in a quiet car	8
so I returned this item.	6
I want something better quality.	3
This is very basic.	6
Also, in daylight	6
when you turn on/pff the bluetooth,	6
the green flashing light	4
(or red)	6
is so dull	4
that it was difficult to tell	4
if the item was on or off.	4

B005OTZJ2Q-0021
Item delivery just as described!	6
Very easy to use and compatible with all of my phones!	2 4
Light to the ear.	1
I just wish	6
ear holder could had been of a flexible plastic	3
because it breaks quite easily.	3

B005OTZJ2Q-0028
This is the first headset	6
I've ever owned	6
and this is one of the best units out there.	6
RocketFish makes some excellent products	6
and this is one of their finest.	6
The sound quality is great,	8
the style is very cool and the unit feels top quality.	5
I highly recommend this Bluetooth Headset.	6
Fast shipping, excellent communication, and outstanding Seller.... thank you!	6

B005RUOUHW-0010
The device has great sound quality, best of any bluetooth	8
I've tried,	8
but how it hangs on your ear makes it useless.	4
The mic boom needs to be close to your cheek for the person on the other end	4
to hear	4
but the design does not allow this	6
so I have to push the mic boom close to my cheek	4
when I talk.	4
This defeats the purpose of `` hands free. ''	4

B005RUOUHW-0022
While the sound is good	8
when up next to your ear,	8
it is the most uncomfortable and insecure fitting ear piece	1
I have ever used.	1
It is so incredibly large	1
and allows for very little adjustment.	4
I could not deal with this while busy	6
doing cleaning	6
or trying to drive.	6
Something tells me long term use	6
would involve some throwing of said device...	6
Two nice things are	6
that it closes up nice	4
and is easy to turn on and pair.	4

B005RUOUHW-0029
I was a little disappointed with this.	6
Headset.	6
On the plus side, the call quality is good	8
and the volume is decent.	8
On the negative side the piece	4
that fits in your ear	4
is not easy to put back on the headset	4
once it comes off,	4
the volume buttons are not convenient	4
and the flap	4
that flips up	4
for charging	4
gets in the way.	4
It is not the most comfortable of headsets either.	1

B005RUOUHW-0059
Wind and noise cancellation are beyond incredible!	8
Volume is great.	8
The fit is the issue.	1
It does not fit tightly.	1
It often has the `` about-to-fall-off feel '',	1
which causes the user to seek out a mirror	1
and check the fit.	1
Turning the head too abruptly or too much will cause the HS to fall off.	1
If Jabra modified the design	6
to use an ear gel	1
it would fix the fit issue.	1
Jabra, please do that for the Supreme 2.	6

B005RUOUHW-0106
I have owned this blue tooth about 2 weeks now and absolutely love it!	6
The longer microphone increases the sound quality for the people I call.	8
Calls are crisp and clear on both ends.	8
I love	4
how the arm folds down	4
to turn off.	4
Great battery saver.	0
To answer a call,	4
all I have to do	4
is extend the arm	4
and it quickly connects to the phone	4
and answers the call.	4
The ear hook is strong yet flexible for a comfortable fit.	1 3
It adjusts easily	4
without even taking it off.	4
Very easy to put on.	4
As for the ear pad,	1
once you get used	1
to it being a little looser,	1
you will love the comfort.	1
Charges quickly, travels well in small places.	0
This is much	6
like having the quality of an over the head bluetooth	6
without all the bulk!	6
Well worth the price!	6

B006B9GRM4-0011
I agree with the other reviews	6
that state these headphones have pretty good sound	8
...	6
when they work.	6
I have had mine for about a week	3
and the left headphone doesn't have sound now.	8 3
I am	6
assuming it is a sweat related issue,	6
because I only wear them to run/lift weights.	6
They do not seem to be sealed very well at all,	3
allowing sweat or moisture in with ease.	3
I will say this,	6
they are quite comfortable,	1
the neck band doesn't touch my neck at all allowing for free movement.	1
Using as a bluetooth for phone calls is terrible as well.	8
The ear plugs block out so much sound	8
I feel	8
like I'm talking with my fingers	8
plugging my ears.	8
People on the receiving end say	8
it sounds	8
like I'm in a box.	8
I do not recommend these headphones	6
if you plan	6
on breaking a sweat.	6

B006B9GRM4-0037
I would not recommend this headphone for runners.	6
I bought this in a package for the motoactv.	6
The sound is very good and pairing is pretty easy.	8 2 4
However, during my first run, within the first mile, they just came off.	1
Pretty annoying	6
when you are	6
trying to focus on your pace, breathing	6
and have to constantly adjust your headphones.	1
Just to have them come off.	1
Maybe for a cyclist this would work, not for runners.	6
Right now they are	6
collecting dust in my car's glove compartment.	6

B006B9GRM4-0060
These were my first bluetooth headphones,	6
and I loved the change from corded headphones.	6
They stayed in place well during running.	1
Occasionally after I started sweating	6
I would readjust them,	6
but not a big deal.	6
They never completely fell off	1
while running.	1
Battery life is sufficient.	0
After about a year or so it started to fail.	3
Other online reviews indicate	6
the sweat might be the culprit.	6
For the price I'm okay	6
writing them off at this point.	6

B006B9GRM4-0073
I use these mainly for working out.	6
So far they've done great over the past 2 months.	6
I'd give a 5 star,	6
but they still don't fit exactly perfect into my ears.	1
The seal from the buds never completely seals	1
as I think	1
it should.	1
I have never found a pair	6
that fit exactly though,	6
so maybe I just have oddly shaped ears,	6
who knows.	6
They sound good,	8
but could be slightly louder at top volume as well.	8
Overall happy with the purchase though,	7
as they weren't expensive	7
(purchased on Cyber Monday)	7

B006B9GRM4-0098
I am very happy with this product.	6
Works great for my morning workouts.	6
Battery lasts a long time.	0
Very comfortable to wear.	1
Also the different ear pieces ensure a great fit to your ears.	1
Really glad I purchased this product.	6
I use it with a Droid Bionic phone.	6

B009CRH0O6-0024
I really liked the color of this bluetooth.	5
I bought all three models, HM1900, HM1700 and the HM1300.	6
This model had the most vibrant color	5
but I saw a similiar one for five or below.	6
The calls were not all that clear and callers complained of hearing feedback and not being able to hear me well on the call.	8
The ear piece	3
that goes around the ear	6
breaks easily on all of the models and the extra inserts	1 3
hurt my ear	1
making me have to purchase a new bluetooth	6
because the extras all broke and the others provided hurt.	6
If you are looking for cuteness	5
then get it	6
but the sound is horrible.	8

B009CRH0O6-0046
Let's be honest,	6
it's cheap,	7
so it acts like a cheap headset.	6
Does not fit well,	1
hard to hear,	8
picks up a lot of background noise.	8
But for as often as I use it,	6
It gets the job done.	6

B009CRH0O6-0088
In terms of function it works	6
just as promised -	6
easy pairing and good clear sound.	8 2
The placement of the on/off button is a bit unreachable	4
when attached to the ear but just as turning it on or off	6
before putting it on solves that issue.	6
Also, there is a function	4
to turn of the indicators light,	4
but it hasn't bothered me yet.	6
In terms of fit,	1
it is a bit on the hard side,	1
i will try to look for another cushion in hopes	6
of solving that issue.	6

I bought this product as a gift	6
and they say	6
they love it!	6
It connects quickly to any device	2
and it is recognized very quickly.	6
However, the ear piece hook broke very easily after about a week wearing.	3
Luckily it comes with spare ear hooks.	6
It has been 2 weeks since using the spare and so far so good.	6
The first one was probably just a defect.	6

Works AMAZINGLY.	6
I bought	6
this for my boyfriend cause	6
he works all day with his hands	6
and he hates the headphones	6
hanging out and about.	6
Anyway, the device is small	6
but fits in his ear perfectly	1
and comes with extra ear pieces,	6
they are small and careful SO BE CAREFUL	6
when handeling them cause they seem easily breakable.	3
But it looks great	5
and he loves it,	6
connected perfectly the first time	2
he connected to his phone.	2
The calls from him are clear and not as much background noise	8
as I expected and has volume control on the actual device	4
which is nice!	6
I am going to purchase one for myself soon!	6
