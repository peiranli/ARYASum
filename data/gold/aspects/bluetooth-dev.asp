The appearance of this Bluetooth headset looks fine.	5
But the microphone is basically a crap.	8
You will get enhanced NOISE rather than enhanced voice.	8
Everybody complains	8
that he/she can not hear me	8
when I use this crappy Soyo headset with my cellphone.	8

B000GUDPDI-0005
The earpiece for this bluetooth blocks sound out too much.	8
My last bluetooth could be worn all day	6
and I would forget	6
I had it on.	6
This unit also has a lot of issues with interruption in the conversation.	8
Either the party	8
I am speaking to	8
complains	8
that I am ` breaking up '	8
or I have trouble	8
hearing them	8
because they are breaking up.	8
It was an inexpensive piece,	7
but I would still have expected better quality.	3
I will use this	6
until I find a better replacement.	6
And believe me,	6
I will look a lot closer	6
at what is out there instead of wasting any money on inferior products.	6

B000GUDPDI-0008
I found the in-ear piece a little large for my smaller body type	1
(I guess	6
I have smaller ears as well)	6
since it is very inflexible getting it in your ear.	1
It's not the best quality product,	3
but it works,	6
and only cost me $ 20.	7
The colored lights	4
flashing different amounts of time	4
can be confusing,	4
you 've	6
got to learn what they mean,	6
and if you don't use this for a while	6
and go back to it	6
like I did	6
-- well you have to learn them all over again,	6
which was annoying.	6
It really is only a mediocre product,	6
but it's still a working bluetooth headset,	6
and for the price I paid	6
I can't really complain much.	6

B000GUDPDI-0016
The Soyo FreeStyler 500 may be the cheapest bluetooth headset on the market,	7
but it works just fine.	6
Can't say	6
how long it will last,	3
but it's holding up fine after a few months.	3
It synced with my phone easily,	2
and it sounds pretty good.	8
It could be a little louder,	8
and the earhook isn't very good,	1
but for $ 10, you won't be disappointed.	7

B000GUDPDI-0025
I got this bluetooth for my 16 year old,	6
since he will be driving soon	6
and he will need one.	6
He just LOVES it.	6
And I loved the price!!	7
The sound is great on my end	8
and he says	8
it sounds good on his.	8
I would purchase it again	6
and recommend it to others.	6

B0017KXLC6-0000
This was my first bluetooth	6
and it was never comfortable.	1
I'm female have smaller ears	6
and wear glasses.	6
It's very heavy	1
and it pulled my ear down from the weight.	1
Squished my eye glasses arm to my head	6
and it hurt constantly.	1
The sound quality wasn't very good!!	8
It never did fit properly	1
so I didn't want to wear it.	1
I Can not recommended this headset to anyone!!!	6
But	6
if you wear glasses I can recommended the H680 Motorola!	6
Lite, small, great sound, and fits great	6
if you have small ears or wear glasses!!!	6

B0017KXLC6-0023
It worked okay for a while but then it unpaired from my cell phone.	2
I've tried everything	6
and it won't pair anymore.	2
I bought a Jabra to replace it	6
and haven't had any problems.	6
Don't waste your money on this expensive trinket.	6

B0017KXLC6-0030
I have never had a bad H700.	6
This one has a problem with the volume	8
(both receiving and transmitting).	8
I am not a novice to this type of device	6
so rest assured	6
that I have tried everything short or taking it apart to increase the quality of audio.	8
I really like this model	6
and will probably try another one	6
after I get over this one	6
not working up to the quality standard	3
to which I had become accustom.	6
Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset	6
(Nickel)	6

B0017KXLC6-0038
This H700 headset is a great headset.	6
When I ordered this unit I was looking for something	6
that would have better volume and clarity than my Motorola HS850.	8
The HS850 was good. But the H700 is smaller,	5
has better volume & seems to have longer battery life.	8 0
It also fits tighter to your head.	1
It also uses the same charger as my cell phone.	0 4
This makes it more convenient	4
when it comes time	6
to charge it.	0
It also has 3 colors	0
as it is charging.	0
Red at the start of the charge.	0
Yellow half way thru the charge, and Green when is fully charged.	6
I have no regrets in using this headset	6
it works well.	6
Mike.	6

B0017KXLC6-0045
I absolutelly love this little head set.	6
This is my second one	6
as unfortunately I found out	6
they do not survive the washing machine very well.	6
It fits around the ear very well and does not intrude inside the ear canal	1
as some do.	6
Sound quality is at least as good if not better than the speaker on my cell phone.	8
I have been	8
told that sound quality of the mic is equally good by those	8
talking to me.	8
I really love the folding mic and the smooth body	4
when carrying it in my pocket.	6
This set is so comfortable	1
that I usually prefer to wear this instead of use my phone	1
to talk, even for a short time.	6
I like it well enough	6
that	6
when my local phone store stopped carrying it,	6
I went online	6
and searched	6
until I found one	6
I could	6
special order!	6
I have discovered recently	6
that this headset does not work well with my new Moto Droid.	2
Reception problems made it nearly impossible for the other person	8
to hear	8
what I was saying.	6
I finally had to part with it, along with my old Moto Razor,	6
and replaced with a Jawbone II and a Moto Droid.	6

B001DDPN9G-0003
Purchased this about 3 months ago.	6
I write this in hope of keeping someone	6
of making an expensive mistake on this item.	7
I use this primarily during exercise	6
(stationary bike, ellipical, etc.).	6
It has 2 major issues.	6
First, it is not designed well	1
causing it to fit poorly around ear.	1
Second, bluetooth connection works intermitently	2
even when is same exact position from time to time.	2
I recently purchased Motorola product	6
which works 10 times better.	6

B001DDPN9G-0008
I really wanted to like these.	6
My problem with the Jaybirds is the fitting.	1
The ear buds never fill snug in your ear,	1
I'm constantly readjusting and readjusting.	1
The # 1 problem is the cord behind the neck.	1
I'm surprised not a lot of reviews	6
mentioned this,	6
but the damn cord sticks to the back of your neck and	6
when you turn your head there goes one of the ear pieces	1
dangling at your shoulder	1
(my biggest annoyance with wired headphones).	6
If it was not for this	6
I might have kept mine,	6
but I guess	6
this is	6
why there are many headphones	6
that are built with a sold band behind the neck.	6

B001DDPN9G-0023
Only buy this product	6
if you intend to ALWAYS use it IN AN ARMBAND.	6
I have used these earphones on an iPhone 3GS and T-Mobile G1.	6
The audio becomes VERY choppy	8 2
if the device is not within the `` optimal zone ''	2
which is recommended in the manual.	2
The `` optimal zone '' is on the right side of the body from ear, down to waist.	2
Therefore when my phone is in my jeans pocket the performance is terrible.	2
The sound cuts in and out regularly totally disrupting enjoyment of the music.	8 2
Other than this problem	6
(which is forcing me to return it)	6
i find this device very good.	6
BUT i would also highly recommend the ACOUSTIBUDS - Premium Adapters for Earphones	8
if you are any way	8
interested in good sound quality.	8
The stock earbuds lose a lot of the low end	8
because of a poor in ear fit.	8 1
Also, don't rely on using this for phone use.	6
You need to speak very loudly for the mic	8
to pick up the sound.	8
Otherwise the person on the other end wont be able to hear you.	8

B001DDPN9G-0034
As a Personal Trainer I workout often	6
so I require comfort	1
and ease with my headphones,	4
without all those messy wires!	6
The JayBird provides that -	1 4
these are great headphones	6
although I think	6
I prefer the WiFi interaction better	2
since I use my cell phone as the music player ;	6
the bluetooth cuts out quite often	2
if you stray too far from the player -	2
range is about 5 feet	2
and I'd prefer	6
if the charge could hold longer.	0

B001DDPN9G-0051
Overall I think	6
these are a great product.	6
I had a wireless headphone from logitech,	6
but they hurt my ears after about 20 minutes	6
wearing them.	6
The Jaybird are very comfortable.	1
I often have them on for over 1 hour,	1
and sometimes forget	1
that I have them on.	1
They don't move once in place	1
and the sound quality is great.	8
I have only had them for about 1 month	6
so I can't comment on how long they will last,	3
but	6
if you take care of them,	6
I can't see any reason	6
why they wouldn't last for a few years.	6

B002LEVL56-0002
This is the worst headset	6
I've ever owned.	6
It has no on or off button.	4
Seriously, no on or off button.	4
You have to hold down the redial button	6
to turn it off.	6
If you don't hold it down long enough,	6
it will redial the last person	6
you talk to.	6
If you keep the headset in your pocket	6
and you bump into it,	6
it will redial the last person	6
you talked to.	6
You're better off getting a headset	6
that doesn't do butt dialing!	6

B002LEVL56-0005
I have purchased this item before	6
and never had a problem but the last order	6
(I got 2)	6
and both of them were too low.	8
No matter how much I turned up the volume, it was very difficult for me to hear the person on the other end...	8
but, coincidentally, THEY were able to hear conversations	8
my neighbors were having... thru the walls	8
(????)	6

B002LEVL56-0010
Ear piece	1
that attaches to the ear	1
feels slightly uncomfortable for me	1
and after 2 hours in my ear, my earlobe becomes sore.	1
The voice quality is not crystal clear,	8
I have to ask people to repeat what they are saying sometimes, similar to the quality of my phones speakerphone.	8
However, its sold at a great price,	7
and has good compatability for my blackberry, LG encore phone, and my PS3.	2

B002LEVL56-0016
This is an excellent headset, and great for the price!	7
One came with my Blackberry,	6
and I ordered another for a spare.	6
Very durable, clarity and noise cancelling is great.	8 3
Love that it uses same charger as my blackberry as well.	0

B002LEVL56-0029
For 12 bucks this was a great deal.	7
LG is known for making quality products	6
and have come a very long way.	6
It easily paired to my phone,	2
and voice quality was pretty good.	8
I have no complaints about the product.	6
Why spend 30 dollars for a headset	6
that has the same quality as this one.	6
It fits comfortably around the ear,	1
often I forgot	6
it was even there.	6

B002SUCYFO-0000
This bluetooth headset doesn't work very well.	6
No buds fit my ear.	1
The charge slot is loose, easily gets disconnected during charging.	6
Network connection often gets disconnected too.	2
The bottomline is	6
that this is a cheap product. don't waste you money on it.	7 3

B002SUCYFO-0004
Maybe I got a defective unit,	6
worked only for 3 months	3
and then it died,	6
not charging or responding,	0 3
it worked well,	6
easy to use features	4
but I wish	6
it lasted long	3

B002SUCYFO-0007
EDIT : June 19 2010 :	6
The headset randomly turns off at times,	3
but the battery life is good so still merits 3 stars.	0
This is a very light headset,	6
and fits comfortably and snugly	1
without having to use the ear loop.	1
Sound quality is fine,	8
and it was easy to pair it with my phone.	2
One added	6
bonus is	6
that it uses the same charger as Nokia phones,	0
so I have to keep track of one less thing.	6
The headset gets	6
only four stars	6
because its range is not as good as my old Philips headset -	2
the max range	2
for this is about twenty feet,	6
not even close to the 33 foot Bluetooth spec.	2
When you start approaching the range limit,	2
you will hear static,	8 2
and the headset will unpair	2
once you are out of range	6
without automatically repairing	4
when you get back.	4

B002SUCYFO-0014
This Nokia Bluetooth headset is perfect for beginners	6
who dont want to spend a hefty amount on their first bluetooth headset.	7
That said,	6
this is a really good headset,	6
it comes with 3 different size ear-buds	1
to find the best fit for your ear.	1
The sound quality is good	8
and the people on other end didnt find any problem with my voice.	8
It was easy to setup with my Samsung Galaxy S.The only problem	2 4
is that the ear-bud is too hard	1
and starts hurting after a while,	1
but that is fine	6
as I dont plan	6
to wear it for longer durations.	6

B002SUCYFO-0025
The products works	6
like indicated.	6
The only small issue is the fit on the ear.	1
Its OK for my ear,	1
but my wife had to remove the ear insert	1
to fit in her ear.	1
However, the product works fine,	6
sound can be easily varied and recharge is simple.	8 0

B005LL8IFM-0002
First day was great ;	6
then I couldn't get it to charge,	0
and then I couldn't get it to link to my Galaxy III.	2
Next, a piece of the stem broke off	3
and it's been DOA ever since.	6
Pure and utter crap.	6
There is something	6
to be said	6
for `` you get	6
what you pay for... ''	7

B005LL8IFM-0008
I'd been generally happy with my Motorola SD-H9 bluetooth headset,	6
but was attracted to how this unit folded up into a hard case.	6
That part is fine.	6
What hasn't been fine is	6
how the sound varies every time	8
I put them on,	6
based on how it's fitting into my ears.	6
Sometimes the sound is fine,	8
sometimes it's muffled,	8
and I haven't yet found any way	8
of getting that	8
to be consistently good.	8
Most bluetooth headsets have some options	1
that allow adjustment in fit,	1
but that isn't true for this unit.	1
It may work very well for some, but unfortunately not for me.	6

B005LL8IFM-0014
Not very durable.	3
Worked fairly well for a short period.	6
First the plastic cracked on both sides	3
where the adjustment/slider goes.	3
Taped that	6
and moved on.	6
Then it totally died	6
while I was using it.	6
Cant get any audio out of it anymore	8
even though it connects.	2
Save your money,	6
try something else.	6

B005LL8IFM-0017
I have been through two sets.	6
Love, love, love them,	6
but they won't last.	3
The manufacturer replaced my first set	6
and working on my next,	6
but it just won't hold up to sweat.	3
My first one	6
the ear piece went out	3
and the second one the volume is messed up.	8 3
It is lightweight	1
and I have been using the second one for at least five months sweating every morning,	3
but it finally toasted it.	3
It's hard to find a good wireless	6
set out there	6
that will hold up..	6

B005LL8IFM-0021
Love this headset!	6
Absolutely met my expectations	6
(a lightweight, comfortable, over-the-head headset	1 3
that would me workout	6
without having to tote my iPhone around with me).	6
The set sounds good, had great range	8 2
(roughly 100 feet),	2
and connects easily.	2
It's also nicely solid feeling.	6
Sometimes with headsets, in an effort	6
to go for lightweight,	6
manufacturers have	6
created flimsy feeling headsets.	6
Not this one.	6
It's solid feeling, substantial.	1 3
It doesn't feel	3
like it's going to break the first time	3
you use it.	6
Yet, it's not overly heavy either.	1
Basically, it's a great headset	6
that does exactly what it advertises.	6
That's 5 stars to me!	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0004
I could not get this headset to work.	6
It connected with my phone easily	2
but each time I was on the phone	2
it would drop and reconnect every 10 seconds	2
so that I couldn't use it	2
(even though I was sitting right next to my phone).	6
I returned it	6
and received a refund.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0009
There's apparently no noise-cancellation in these.	8
Can't use it on the bicycle	6
without turning it around backwards.	6
The battery life is...	0
bizarre.	0
You can charge the thing	0
until the green light comes on,	0
turn it on and half an hour later	0
you're getting the three-tone " low power " noise...	0
or sometimes the thing will work for days	0
and never give you a low-power tone,	0
and suddenly turn itself	0
because the battery's dead.	0
I won't complain about them too much,	6
they're worth every one of the 150 cents	7
I spent on them,	6
but they're just not very good.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0012
I would really like it	6
if it would stay in my ear	1
or if the loop	1
that went around my ear	6
would hold it to my ear.	6
Other then	6
that it looks great,	5
the price is great	7
and it paired up to my phone easily.	2
None of that matters	6
if I can't get it to stay in place though.	6
Nice unit for a person	6
that can install a different loop on it,	6
or has a different type of holder?	6
It does work good.	6
The seller got	6
it here super quick as well.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0020
Great product for the cost.	7
Lightweight and comfortable fit in the ear.	1
Can use with or without behind the ear clip, however, you run the risk	1
of it falling off	6
without using the clip.	6
Since I purchased it I	6
have worn the clip all day	6
when I am working.	6
Sometimes I even forget	6
it is there.	6
With my hands free I don't hav eto worry	6
about missing any calls.	6
There is a slight echo	8
when I speak occasionally.	8
Based on feedback from others I can be heard clearly	8
when it is use.	8
For a economic product this is a great buy.	6

B005OTZJ2Q-0026
Bought it used,	6
but you can't tell.	6
It holds a charge great, is light enough	0 1
to forget	1
you have it in your ear, works well in volume and mic,	8 1
and fits perfectly in my ear.	1
My only gripe is	6
that sometimes there's a small lapse between my voice	8
and	6
when it goes into the phones audio.	8
I haven't pinpointed the cause of this yet so it might not be the Bluetooth's fault.	6

B005RUOUHW-0005
Very disappointed in the performance of this headset.	6
I bought it for the noise reduction	8
to be used in an office environment	8
that can be a little loud at times.	8
I receive nothing but complaints from the people I'm talking to about the noise in the background	8
while using this headset.	8
I've even received complaints about not being heard	8
clearly while in my own quiet apartment.	8
Overall I wish	6
I could return it	6
if I didn't already throw away the packaging.	6
Waste of money	6

B005RUOUHW-0015
I purchased this bluetooth headset back on 12/29/2011.	6
The earpiece looks nice	5
but the audio quality is very bad!!!	8
Everyone was either telling me	8
that they could not hear me or	8
that my voice sounded muffled and far away.	8
I tried to use the headset in different environments and with different people	8
but the responses were all the same.	8
Please look into a different bluetooth earpiece or you will be sadly disappointed!!!	6

B005RUOUHW-0027
PROs :	6
The headset's voice prompts are helpful.	4
The set up was easy, even with various and multiple simultaneous devices.	2 4
The noise-cancelling effect of the sound in the earphone.	8
Easy power on-off,	4
just by flipping the mic boom open or closed.	4
CONs :	6
the balance and ear hook allows it ` flop around ' a bit too much for my liking.	1
It is on the outside and not in your ear at all.	1
If you are moving around,	6
it feels like it going to fall off.	1
The voice quality on the other end of the conversation	8
I have been told is very poor, and much worse than other headsets.	8
Bottom line	6
for me is the poor comfort and the poor other party quality	8 1
outweighs the good qualities.	6
I am sad about this, because I really, really like some of their other products	6
(and I wish	6
those had voice	6
prompts).	6

B005RUOUHW-0055
This headset sounds good, has great options	8 4
and is comfortable to wear.	1
You will get about 5-6 hours of talk time on a full battery charge.	0
It has active noise cancellation	8
and blocks out most of the background noise.	8
It also has easy to use voice commands for common things	4
like answering or ignoring a phone call	4
so you can answer the phone easily	4
without even touching your phone.	4
The setup was easy	4
and it has worked like a charm for me for three months now!	4

B005RUOUHW-0095
Connecting the device to my iPhone was simple.	2 4
I didn't even need to look at the directions.	4
Battery meter shows up at the top of the phone.	0
I don't leave it on for long periods of time,	1
but it's comfortable	1
when I do have it on.	1
Sound quality is good	8
and people can hear me clearly.	8
When it's not being worn the mic folds in,	4
which turns it off,	4
so its pretty small.	6

B006B9GRM4-0004
I was a little concerned	6
for how it would feel and look.	1 5
No need to worry with this.	6
Mutliple sets of ear buds allows me to wear the correct size.	1
I have had this for almost 2 months,	6
battery life is good.	0
No issues with device so far.	6
Update after several months and issues.	6
Shortly after having this for 5 months,	3
the battery stopped charging.	0 3
Because their was moisture that	3
was leaking into the recharging port.	3
Thought it would be a simple fix with motorola.	6
What a headache!!!!!	6
They replaced it minus my shipping costs for a new one.	6
Had it for 2 weeks and same thing happened again.	3
This time motorola didn't have these in stock	6
and sent me an S11 Flex.	6
I probably will never buy another motorola product	6
based on quality of device and such poor customer service.	6
Not sure there is anything else to add.	6
Its a shame,	6
because I liked the device,	6
but because of poor engineering and or cheap labor, its	6
not worth $ 5.	6

B006B9GRM4-0030
These started off great, easy pairing, awesome sound and easy button control,	8 2 4
however within a week they would turn off and on by themselves for no reason.	3
I wouldn't even be wearing them	6
and it would happen.	6
I can not explain how frustrating these have been.	6
I would keep them	6
if I could just get this problem	6
resolved	6
because all the other features worked great for me.	6

B006B9GRM4-0052
I've owned a pair of these for about 4 months.	6
I use them	6
for running.	6
They are the most comfortable pair of wireless headphones	1
I've ever owned.	1
The sound is very good.	8
About a week ago the LED power light quit working	3
and now yesterday they won't turn on at all.	3
I will now have to deal with Motorola	6
in getting a replacement.	6
It's been a long known issue with all Motorola wireless headphones	3
that they can't handle sweat	3
so if you're using these	6
while working out you may want to look else where.	6

B006B9GRM4-0072
Had these for about six months now.	6
Audio quality is great	8
and I enjoy	6
listening to music while at the gym	6
or when going shopping.	6
The control buttons	4
(particularly the volume)	4
could be a little tricky and not as friendly to use.	4
The headset is light	1
and fits comfortably in my ears	1
(though it takes some time	1
to find the right angel	1
and fit it right in).	1
Talk quality is a problem.. not the best and I was told I am sound	8
like I am inside a water tank...	8
luckily for me most of the use is for listening.	6

B006B9GRM4-0086
These headphones are fantastic.	6
They have great sound quality.	8
They are easy to use and connect to my phone.	2 4
Also they are comfy	1
and stay in my ears.	1
There are really only two things	6
that I would want people to be wary about are	6
that they are kinda complicated to get in,	4
I have let 2 people try them on and they couldn't quite figure out how to do it but	4
once you put them in they fit.	1 4
The other thing is	6
if you are wearing something with a high collar	6
that hits the back wire	6
it can displace the headphones.	1
Other than those two things these headphones are amazing.	6

B009CRH0O6-0007
I gave this headset a try	6
because it's made by Samsung.	6
Big mistake.	6
It's real junk.	6
The ear hook doesn't rotate back	1
and the unit is very hard to put on.	1 4
The ear bud is too big and the other ones	6
that came as replacements aren't the same configuration as the installed one	6
and there are no instructions on how to install them.	4
The sound quality is bad	8
and the noise reduction sucks.	8
The answer switch only works	6
when it's in the mood.	6
I'm going back to the Plantronics M50	6
that actually works.	6

No matter how high you turn it up, you can barely hear anything	8
being said,	8
regardless of background noise.	8
The fit is excellent.	1
Feels great in my ear.	1
You can tell	6
it won't fall off	1
without being too tight.	1
The controls are simple and easy to manipulate	4
while it's on your head.	6
I REALLY wanted this thing to work	6
because it meets all of my requirements for a solid Bluetooth device...	6
...	6
if only I could hear my phone conversation.	8

The price is right for sure.	7
The call recipients on the other hand can hear me fine,	8
but the volume is not that great	8
when listening to them.	8
Also, it does not seem to automatically link up with my samsung galaxy s4	2
when I turn it on.	6
Not sure	6
if that is the phone or the blue tooth.	6
It seems hard to get a good fit in the ear.	1
So it functions at about what you would expect for the price.	6

I have to say	6
that am very happy with this bluetooth.	6
For the price of this device, is pretty good.	7
It doesn't have crystal clear sound,	8
but it's pretty decent for the price	8 7
and what I use it for.	6
The battery is pretty good as well.	0
I would recommend this device to any one	6
who is just looking for a basic bluetooth.	6

I have been very pleased with this headset.	6
It is easy to connect with my phone	2
and has sufficient volume	8
to be understood.	8
Controls are simple and easy to learn,	4
and the price is very reasonable.	7
