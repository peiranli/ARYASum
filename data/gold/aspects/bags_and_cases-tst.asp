B0000A2QBX-0001
I purchased this case	4
because it looked very functional...	4
To my surprise the rivets popped out and the zipper broke about two weeks into it's use.	7
I have never been disappointed by a Sampsonite product until now.	4
I have written to them	1
and received no communication in return!	1

B0000A2QBX-0012
I bought	4
this case for Dell Inspiron E1505	4
(15. 4 '')	4
screen.	4
It was way too small.	8
This case has an inner pocket,	0
which is the actual spot for the laptop	4
to slip in.	4
I will say	4
it can only fit a 14 '' screen.	8
I ended up	4
putting my laptop outside the inner pocket,	8
which barely fit.	8
I wish	4
the manufacturer noticed this problem and not listed for any 15 '' + screens.	4

B0000A2QBX-0018
The case itself looks pretty high quality,	7
but it's too thin.	8
Getting the laptop in and out of the case is a huge hassle	8
requiring both hands and lots	4
of pulling.	4
I have a 15. 4 '' Widescreen Dell Dimensions 1501.	4
It fits in there snug,	8
but as I stated above, getting the computer in and out is pain	8
(my wife is trying to convince me to return it,	4
but I'm too lazy,	4
I think	4
we'll just keep it).	4
Also,	4
if you have a wireless mouse,	8
it bulges out.	8
Again, it has to do with the case	8
being so thin.	8
To some this characteristic may be very desirable	4
because the case is very low profile,	4
but	4
if you have perfiferals like a wireless mouse or a A/C adapter	4
that is more than an inch thick,	4
it bulges out.	4
There's padding, of course,	6
so your periferals probably will not be damaged...	6
it just looks kinda funny.	3

B0000A2QBX-0034
Functionality wise : awesome!	4
Has room for a lot of stuff,	8
and keeps the computer really protected,	6
and that's the most important feature a case	4
like that can have.	4
Doesn't look shiny and fancy, though,	3
and it's something	4
I look	4
for in everything I buy.	4
But it varies from a person to another, obviously.	4
Anyway I recommend.	4

B0000A2QBX-0069
Very happy with the Samsonite L35 Notebook Case.	4
Fits my MacBook with plenty of room.	8
Lots of pokets for my mouse, mouse pad, and accessories.	0
Just the right size	8
for what I wanted.	4
Nice looking, and well built.	7 3

B0009JR5K0-0003
I purchased this rolling bag about six months ago.	4
I travel frequently for work	4
and depend on this bag	4
to get me through airports and into and out of schools.	4
The telescoping handle	2 7
stopped retracting about a month ago	2 7
and an airline agent showed me how to push the little button in the rear compartment	4
to free the mechanism.	4
Picture lots of people	4
waiting as I unzipped the bag	4
to fool with the handle on shuttle buses, in airline aisles, etc..	4
Then last week	4
the black plastic handle	2 7
that is supposed to cradle inside the other handle	2 7
snapped off the bag	2 7
as a bus driver lifted it.	4
I am going to contact Kensington about a refund	4
because the bag is still under warrantee.	4
I do not want a replacement	4
unless the bag has been redesigned.	4
I really liked that vertical design of this bag	8
because it could be pulled down aisles in planes.	4

B0009JR5K0-0007
I've used this once	4
and it really didn't meet my expectations.	4
I've been	4
looking for a carry on bag	4
that works for me	4
and this isn't it.	4
Besides that, it's already	7
starting to fall apart.	7

B0009JR5K0-0011
There were several things	4
I liked about this bag.	4
Shoe storage on each side of the handle is a smart use of space.	0
The pockets made sense as well.	0
So nice organization in this bag I returned it	4
because I just didn't like the look	3
and needed more room for clothing and less for files.	0
This bag might be better suited to men then women.	4
Just personal preference.	4

B0009JR5K0-0020
I needed a laptop bag with wheels	4
since I was tired of carrying around my heavy bookbag at the airport	4
... this one is great,	4
so many compartments,	0
the wide-set wheels help prevent it from tipping over,	4
and the handle is comfortable.	2
My only complaint is the finishing strip on the back side at the base came off very quickly,	7
but I didn't really care that much.	4

B0009JR5K0-0028
I 've	4
been looking for a carry-on bag	4
that would accommodate my laptop, some clothing and personnel items.	4
This is a well made bag	7
and is a dream to roll thru the airport.	4
It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.	0
A separate center compartment unzips to pull out the laptop for security at the airport.	0
I had been using a laptop backpack	4
to carry my computer and peripherals	4
which got extremely heavy after long periods	4
of hauling around.	4
The price is great	5
compared to other bags with these same features.	5

B000VB7EFW-0003
First time I have	4
been dissappointed with a product from Amazon.	4
Appearantly others are	4
having the same problem with a 17 '' laptop not fitting in the compartment.	8
My laptop is a standard size in the market.	4
The bag may look good	3
but that doesn't help if laptop doesn't fit.	8
Totally dissappointed with SwissGear and Amazon.	1

B000VB7EFW-0009
Like a dummy I ordered it after reading	4
that it doesn't fit some of the 17 '' models.	8
I have an HP	4
and it doesnt fit.	8
On the plus side it does have a lot of nooks and crannies to put stuff in.	0
Just disappointed to find out my laptop doesn't fit.	8
Need to leave it unzipped.	4
Just build it a tad bit bigger	8
and send my one for my idea.	4
You'll have the best on the market!	4
Nice try ` eh	4

B000VB7EFW-0013
I was really excited to get this backpack	4
because I had been carefully searching for a backpack	4
that had to fit my 17 inch laptop.	8
I received my SwissGear backpack	4
and really loved all of the pockets, padded straps,	2 0
all the compartments	0
it had	4
and the durability of the fabric and the price was right.	5 7
In the stores, this backpack would have been at least double the price.	5
But,	4
when I tried to fit my laptop in the compartment	8
it was supposed to go in,	8
it didn't fit.	8
I was really disappointed	4
because everything else about this backpack was really nice.	4
I was able to fit it in another compartment	8
which fits snug,	8
but it doesn't have the padding or strap	2
that is supposed	4
to hold it in place.	4
I did decide to just keep the backpack	4
because of all of it's other features and other uses	4
I have for it and it's ability	0
to hold my laptop in another compartment.	0

B000VB7EFW-0023
My 15. 6 '' HP Pavilion dv6-1360US	4
(14. 9 `` X10. 15 `` X1.33 '')	4
barely fit inside the protective slot for laptop in this bag!	8
When I put my laptop in the protective slot,	8
the laptop get very close to the zipper,	8
and the laptop pushes against the top of the bag	8
(I can see laptop corners through the bag).	8
I have to be VERY careful to zip it to make sure	8
that the zipper does not scratch my laptop.	8
I am a little worried	4
about carrying weight in the bag	4
because it will press against the laptop.	4
The bag does have a bigger space by the protective slot.	6 0
It is big enough for my laptop,	8
but does not have any cushion on the sides	4
(there is a little cushion at the bottom).	4
I may put my laptop here	4
by adding some cushion	4
if I feel too uncomfortable	4
about putting my laptop in the protective slot.	4
Other than this, the bag appears to be rugged and well made.	7
We initially had trouble	4
unzipping the bag	4
because some zipper teeth were not aligned.	4
But	4
after we pushed them in,	4
it works fine.	4
As other reviewers noticed,	4
the mp3 slot is inside the bag.	0
Don't know how useful that it.	0

B000VB7EFW-0029
This is a well constructed product	7
made of quality materials.	7
The color is a true red	3
as I thought	4
it would be	4
and not a hot pink as it appears in the ad.	3
I have read a lot of different opinions	4
about what size laptop fits in it.	8
I have a Sony Vaio	4
that measures 15?1/8 inches long	4
and it fits nicely.	8
I'm not sure	8
that it would fit	8
if it were much longer.	8
It has many pockets for just about anything	0
you might want to carry	0
while traveling.	0
Not sure	4
why I had to pay more for it than the blue or black?	5

B00307F8PW-0001
Crap.	4
The " leather " is already peeling,	7
and the straps are small..	2
I can barely sling it over my shoulder.	2
It will fit a lap top.. and that is about it.	8
Head to TJ Maxx/Ross	4
and find something better	4

B00307F8PW-0005
This is a nice big bag, and super cheap,	5
but I wanted something	4
that wasn't so obviously plastic.	7
I also didn't like the stitching.	7
Just looked cheap.	7
Sent it back.	4

B00307F8PW-0008
Decently sized bag, a bit taller	8
than I had anticipated.	8
Serves its purpose just fine	4
and I'm content with the look of it.	3
The biggest problem is the straps.	2
They're made from some sort of really stiff material.	2 7
You can easily scrape/burn yourself	2
if you're not careful,	2
or it'll hurt	2
if it digs into your shoulder the wrong way.	2
Like others	4
have mentioned, it does smell.	4
Protip : Do not leave a ziploc of crackers in there for more than a day or two.	4
It will acquire the smelly essence of this bag	4
when you later retrieve it.	4
You will taste it,	4
and you will not like it.	4

B00307F8PW-0022
It looks exactly like the picture	3
and works great.	4
Has a couple pockets	0
inside that are convenient	0
and is definitely large enough	8
to hold such a large laptop.	8
Definitely a great value!!!	5

B00307F8PW-0043
This bag is great	4
because it works for a larger laptop.	8
Also, it has a zipper,	0
so you don't have to worry about things	4
falling out of the bag.	4
I use this daily at work	4
because I often have to change meeting rooms/work areas.	4
This bag comfortably fits a laptop, notebooks, pens, etc..	8
It also has little metal " feet " so	4
that the bag will sit upright	4
when you put it on the floor.	4
The outside pocket is handy,	0
but it also has pockets inside for 3 pens, and then 2 larger pockets,	0
which I use for my iphone and smaller items.	4
There's a zippered pocket inside as well.	0
I have a 17 " monitor	4
and looked everywhere for a case	4
that would work.	4
This one works great	4
and looks cute.	3

B0038KLD50-0002
I want to be clear,	4
the vendor	4
that I purchased this hunk of junk from stood up for it	4
and supplied a perfect replacement at no extra charge.	4
As far as the Case Logic bag	4
though I was severely disappointed.	4
I researched for a long time to find what I thougt	4
would be a good bag for my needs.	4
This bag was it	4
until I received it.	4
It came in with a defective zipper	7
and I tried twice to contact the manufacturer Case Logic,	1
and they never even responded.	1
This from a consumer standpoint really turned me off from even considering a Case Logic in the future.	1
I will also never recommend their product to anyone.	4
I will however say the Samsonite replacement	4
that the vendor sent	4
me was great	4
and it worked really well on my trip.	4
Quality was the factor	7
and the zippers on the Case Logic were substandard,	7
so be careful	4
when considering their product.	4

B0038KLD50-0012
I was happy with this bag early on.. seemingly well padded, lots of space and pockets, and an attractive design for a reasonable price.	5 8 0 3
However, after less than 2 weeks of use, the strap	2 7
detached from one side as I	2 7
was walking down the sidewalk.	4
The bag swung down	4
and hit the pavement on one corner,	4
denting in the corner of my laptop.	6
Now, I did have a laptop, battery, and a few notebooks/books in the bag,	4
but I didn't feel	4
that it was significantly overloaded or heavy.	4
Upon closer examination, it appeared	4
that the sewing/seam	7
attaching the strap to the bag	7
is minimal, and probably not very durable	7
(the strap on the other side was also halfway torn out).	4
I was also disappointed	6
the padding underneath was not very effective in protecting my laptop.	6
Overall, its a pretty nice-looking bag, but the seams	3
where the strap attaches to the bag are one pretty significant flaw... just not a durable design.	7
If you do decide to purchase this bag,	4
be sure to keep	4
it loaded very lightly.	4

B0038KLD50-0019
I just bought an Acer Aspire TimelineX 13 '',	4
and the laptop fits perfect there.	8
The case design is the most comfortable	8
that I've had.	4
It's compact, padded everywhere and with a lot of compartments.	6 8 0
The mesh pocket is very useful for the laptop's large power brick.	0
The only downside is that before 2 weeks of very mild use	7
(and only used it to transport the laptop one time from NY to Boston and back)	4
and one of the corners already got ripped.	7
Looks like	7
they're not very durable.	7
I 'm	4
including a pic.	4

B0038KLD50-0040
This laptop case from Case Logic is nice for a non-fancy leathery kind.	4
It is a 13-14 inch case, sadly a little too small for my Toshiba.	8
My Dell would be fine in it, though.	8
It has sufficient pockets and nice padding for the laptop compartment.	6 0
It is black and gray with lime green.	3
The handle is adjustable	2
and I think	4
it would do well in the rain,	4
as it seems	4
the rain would roll right off of it.	4
Overall, a nice well-made product for its level.	7

B0038KLD50-0047
The messenger bag has a place for every thing	0
and for the price it is a great value.	5
I hope the handles wear well	2 7
but I would feel this about any product	4
made of the same material.	7
The bag closes up very nice and is not baggie or sloppy looking,	3
it has good form,	3
that's important to me.	4
The function of the bag and its clean lines are well thought out.	3
Over all a really good purchases.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0001
It was very small and tight.	8
I really did not like it.	4
The pink flowers look really fake and cheap.	3
I have a case on my 13 inch macbook and its very hard	8
to close it.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0005
When I got this case I got it	4
because it said	8
it would fit a 13-14 inch Notebook Laptop Computer.	8
I have a 14 inch	8
and it does not fit.	8
I can not zip it shut.	8
Otherwise the sleeve looks nice, is pretty	3
and seems to be in good condition	3
but I gave it 2 stars	4
because I was misled	4
into purchasing this item	4
and it doesn't even fit my laptop.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0007
When I received the carrying case I thought	4
it was very cute.	3
It looks exactly	3
as it appears in the picture.	3
If you like bright pink then you	3
'll love this!	3
It sorta looks like a sticker with japanese design to it.	3
I have to get use to the bright pink...	3
it looks like it cheapens the look in a way.	3
But I did receive some compliments about the bag -	4
the japanese design is an eye catcher with the bright pink.	3
I purchased the package deal	5
($ 67	5
which is a good deal	5
compared to the one item for $ 50	5
you get from the apple store)	5
...	4
the carrying side bag, case sleeve, pink rubber keyboard cover	3
(which I love!	3
It's a purple pink not too bright).	3

B003BWYJ4C-0016
We have a Macbook Air and a Pro, both 13 '',	4
and we bought two of this sleeve.	4
Fits very well, especially for the Pro, looks pretty, and very light weight.	8 3
One zipper isn't as smooth	7
when it meets the corner,	7
but that's not a problem	4
if handled with care.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0030
I love my pink floral carrying case for my Mac book.	3
It fits perfectly	8
and provides padding for travel.	6
It's also stylish,	3
and matches my pink plastic cover for the laptop.	3
It fits nicely into a backpack	8
without a lot of bulk.	8

B0064RDIWU-0008
This case is awful.	4
The bottom has no way	7
of staying on.	7
Its ridiculous...	4
The styrofoam feet are going to fall off instantly.	7
The material	7
it is made of seems	7
like it would make a good case,	7
but I really don't understand	4
why there is no way the make	8
the bottom part " snap " on.	8
Extremely disappointed...	4

B0064RDIWU-0023
This case looks and feels great,	3
but is not too good for protection.	6
My laptop usually just sits on my desk,	4
which is great for this case, but the first time	4
I decided to take my laptop with me,	4
and placed it in a sleeve inside my backpack,	4
the case	7
developed cracks all over	7
and part of it chipped off.	7
But at 1/4 the price of the Speck cases	5
that I also have,	4
I guess	5
you get	5
what you pay for.	5
Update :	4
after less than six months, all of the rubber feet fell off	7
and the bottom piece cracked to the point	7
that it no longer would stay on.	7
Went back to a Speck case about a month ago	4
and couldn't be happier.	4

B0064RDIWU-0029
It's a nice color	3
and has effectively protected my macbook.	6
However, I've been	4
trying to remove it to clean my computer	8
and it's really difficult for it to come off.	8
I was only able to remove the bottom.	8
Heads up!	4

B0064RDIWU-0052
This case is a gorgeous, bright green color.	3
It's not the most well made, and the last time	7
I bought it	7
it developed a few cracks after a month or two of use.	7
There were a couple sharp areas of plastic	7
I had to file down.	7
However, I bought the case again	4
when my old one wore out	7
(about 7 months after I bought it)	7
because it's cheap	5
and does	5
what I want it to for the price.	5
Plus, a lot of the more expensive cases aren't as bright as this one.	3

B0064RDIWU-0086
I am fussy about everything.	4
I love this cover.	4
It clips on easily,	8
the color is gorgeous Tiffany blue/green,	3
it has a nice satin outer and hard inner side.	3
The apple lite shows through	3
if that is a concern for you.	4
I got this from TopCase in record time.	1
It arrived two days	1
after I ordered it	1
and was in excellent condition.	1

B0083LOW7A-0003
This bag might look nice,	3
but it is of terrible quality.	7
The strap broke after only 3 months,	2 7
and even though they kindly replaced it for me, less than 2 months later the new strap couldn't even click onto the bag	2 7
because the black piece	2 7
that holds the hook completely	2 7
ripped off.	2 7
After emailing them several times,	1
they still wouldn't refund me	1
because they claimed	1
that their warranty lasts only 1 month.	1
Who wants a laptop case	4
that's only guaranteed to last one month?	4
This case is such a waste of money,	5
it would be much more worth	4
it to spend a little more	4
to get a case	4
that lasts.	4

B0083LOW7A-0007
Very fast shipping.	1
Materials are cheap, stitches along the borders are not very secure. barely fit a 14 inch hp sleek notebook.	8 7
Does not worth 25 $.	5
Rather spend 5 more dollars	4
and get a better quality bag than this trash.	7
It doesnt even look as sophisticate	3
as shown in picture ;	3
it look like my 2 years old sister's bag.	3

B0083LOW7A-0011
This bag does not fit my laptop.	8
The pocket inside for the laptop would fit a tablet best.	8
I have a 15 inch screen	4
and it's the only thing	4
I can fit in the bag.	4
The bag is lovely and true to the pic,	3
but make sure	4
you know your computer size first	8
before you get caught up in how cute the bag looks	3
like I did LOL	4

B0083LOW7A-0021
I purchased this for work,	4
as my other one didnt allow much room	4
to keep paper work or folders in it with the laptop.	4
However, I wish	4
they had an outer extended compartment for my power plug.	0
With the laptop, and a few folders, the bag looks and closes nice.	8 3
If i try to put the power cord in as well,	8
the bag looks bulky and doesnt close right.	8
For now i have the power cord in the little red bag	4
that comes with it,	4
but I carry it seperate.	4
Id recommend this to anyone	4
who doesnt plan	4
on carrying much else than their laptop, some pens and a notebook,	8
which the cord will fit in the other side no problem.	8
This would be more of a personal laptop bag	4

B0083LOW7A-0081
The price was good,	5
and it fits my 14 inch Toshiba perfectly.	8
It looks good	3
and holds the cords, my mouse and a mouse pad.	8 0
It is lightweight.	7
It does come with a shoulder strap.	2
I picked this bag	4
because it had cushioning on the inside for extra protection.	6
The only thing	0
I would have liked	0
is an outside pocket.	0
But that is minor.	4
Love the color.	3

B0085B772A-0002
I bought this case with the intent	4
that it would protect my computer.	6
It did the complete opposite,	6
and now the paint on the front part of my computer has worn off in two spots.	4
The front zipper	4
where the charger is placed	4
(as pictured in the photo),	4
wore a hole through the padding,	7
and started to scratch my computer.	7
Avoid this case.	4

B0085B772A-0010
The good :	4
Thin but well padded, inexpensive,	5 7
and good	3
looking sleeve.	3
I loved it	4
when I first opened it.	4
My Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro was slightly loose, but still secure in it.	6 8
I chose this sleeve over the other for the possibility	4
of sticking the power cord into the side pocket in a rush situation.	0
The bad and the ugly.	4
As soon as I put my laptop in the sleeve, I noticed	4
that the sleeve has hidden on the inside two loops	4
that can be pulled out	4
and used	4
to carry the the case with your hands.	4
Neat idea, except that those two loops are attached to the inside of the case with two thick metallic buttons.	4
And guess what,	4
as you slide your laptop in and out of the sleeve,	4
they rub against the exterior of the laptop regularly,	6
making it ripe for scratches and marks.	6
Just what I needed for my delicate ultrabook.	4
Thankfully Amazon has easy returns and this one is going back for sure!	4

B0085B772A-0012
The sleeve gives a good protection	6
and looks rugged enough	7
to be used in backpacks or suitcases.	4
It's light padded	4
but I didn't expect a huge protection from shocks or hits by this kind of sleeves.	6
The downside	4
(that costed two stars to this review)	4
is	4
that there are two small handles with metallic fastener	2
that are normally	2
stowed inside the sleeve.	2
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop	2
so they might end up	4
scratching it.	4

B0085B772A-0042
Not much to say about this,	4
it's a fairly basic neoprene sleeve.	4
It has nice construction for $ 12.	5 7
Steel zipper glides are kept away from scratching your laptop by internal gussets of neoprene.	6
The external pocket is fairly big.	0
Mine is black on the outside and lime green inside, an attractive combination.	3
The sleeve is slightly too big for a new 13 " Macbook Pro.	8
While it's not exactly a " custom fit ",	8
it works fine.	8
No reason to spend any more than this.	5

B0085B772A-0080
This is a nice neoprene sleeve for my MacBook Air.	4
The fit is perfect	8
and it gives a nice amount of padding.	6
It probably won't protect my laptop from a fall,	6
but it's great for day-to-day protection	6
while my laptop is either at my home or tucked inside my briefcase.	4
My only complaint is the interior color -	3
the black case has a BRIGHT lime green interior.	3
I don't care for it,	4
but no one really sees it.	4
Overall, a good value.	5

B009PJ2CQC-0004
This might be a good case for other 13. 3 inch laptop,	4
but it definitely does	8
not fit a Macbook Air 13. 3	8
(2013 model).	4
The case is so small	8
that it's difficult for me to put Macbook Air into it	8
and I could hardly take it out of the case.	8

B009PJ2CQC-0013
I ordered this sleeve for my Lenovo Ideapad.	4
The case was TOO SMALL.	8
The computer fit,	8
but just barely.	8
It's a hassle getting it in or out of the sleeve,	8
and the seams began to tear within a week of receiving it.	7
It's not leather,	7
and it doesn't look like it.	7
I do like the soft material inside,	7
and the magnetic closure is slick.	4
Although it pops open regularly,	4
because the case is too small for the computer	8
it is advertised	8
to fit in the title.	8

I got this as a gift,	4
and I have the Lenovo IdeaPad U310,	4
which it says	4
is compatible.	4
IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.	4
The laptop doesn't fit inside,	8
it's too big by about 1/2in to even fit in the opening,	8
not to mention having	4
to fit the entire height of the computer inside.	8
I'm going to have to buy one size bigger	8
if it's available.	4
It is a very nice-looking case	3
and I hope	4
one size bigger is available.	8

Great!	4
Good price, quick ship, fits a regular 13 '' best.	5 8
My MacBook Pro fits very tightly inside this sleeve so expect that	8
to be a minor problem.	4
Only one I can think of though.	4
Very nice leather and quality product	7
that is definitely worth the money.	5
Looks good and is easy to handle	3
without slipping out of your hands.	4
Also great protection with average use.	6
Recommended.	4

Right size.	8
Good quality.	7
Great price.	5
Don't look further.	4
The Dell notebook is odd shape and leather sleeve	4
(US$ 60),	4
or the nylon one	4
(US$ 30)	4
offered by Dell are not superior to this one.	4
