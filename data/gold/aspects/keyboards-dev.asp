If you 're	7
thinking of getting a new keyboard,	7
spend a few extra dollars	7
and get one	7
that's actually worth using.	7
The layout is tricky, with the enter key bigger than any other key	4
(does anyone have trouble	7
hitting the enter key?)	7
and the backspace key is a tiny little thing	4
that I can never hit the first time	4
without first hitting the \ a million times.	4
The insert/home/delete / end cluster is squished into the print screen/scroll lock/pause keys,	4
which makes quick navigation difficult	3 4
without looking at the keys.	3
The rest of the keys are functional	7
but feel very flimsy.	3
I haven't had a problem with `` squeaky '' keys,	6
but am very frustrated by the backspace	4
being so small and hard to reach.	4
If you're a fan of shortcut buttons,	2
there are the wake up, sleep, and power buttons, but no others for volume, internet, etc..	2
If you 're	7
looking for a cheap, basic model	8
and don't care about retraining yourself to type then	7
this one's for you.	7
Otherwise, spend a few extra dollars	7
and get a keyboard	7
that doesn't feel	3
like you bought it from the dollar shop.	3 8

B0002SAF64-0008
The keys on the one	3
I received do not have a consistent feel across the keyboard.	3
Several don't respond to the same level of pressure as the other keys.	3 0
This makes the keyboard useless for someone	7
who really types fast.	7
This keyboard also mushy, in the sense	3
that your keystrokes decelerate more quickly at the end of the stroke into a mush rather than a solid tap.	3
In contrast, good keyboards for fast typing give increasing resistance up to a point and then less resistance down to solid contact at the bottom.	7
You get a feel	7
for where that resistance breaks	7
(and the letter types),	7
and you can type	7
without hitting the bottom hard on most strokes.	7
On a mushy keyboard like this one, you're never sure	3
if your keystroke has registered,	3
so	7
after typing several sentences	7
missing half the letters,	7
you hit the keys harder to compensate.	7
The spillproof design is interesting though.	2
Not sure	7
why more keyboards don't feature this.	7

B0002SAF64-0012
Pros : Not very expensive, supposedly spill proof, good 104 key layout.	8 4
Usable with both USB and PS2 ports.	1
Decent appearance.	5
Cons :	7
Usual mushy feel of a `` chicklet ''	3
(membrane) keyboard.	3
I keep hoping against hope	7
that I'll find a decent office keyboard with a good `` feel ' at a moderate price.	7
This is not that keyboard.	7
I guess	7
I'll have to give up and just resign myself to much more expensive mechanical key units.	7
However, they start at $ 50 or higher, not a trivial additional amount.	7
Top notch units are $ 100 or more.	7
Ouch!	7
But for anyone	7
who uses a keyboard a lot, well worth the money.	7

B0002SAF64-0018
I have had this keyboard for a few years now	7
and it has functioned	7
without a glitch.	7
I type on it hours a day,	3
and the keys never stick or are hard to press.	3
I took a star away, though,	7
because it does make about as much noise	6
as you could imagine	6
a keyboard would make.	6
I've owned keyboards in the past	7
that were whisper quiet	7
which was nice	7
because the rest of the office didn't have to know	7
whether you were typing or not.	7
They will know with this one.	6
But	7
after going through numerous more expensive keyboards,	7
I have been happy as a lark	7
that this very inexpensive one has been going for years	8
without any issues.	7

B0002SAF64-0027
I just got this keyboard,	7
and I already love it.	7
It has the same	3
satisfying ` clickiness ' of the original IBM PC keyboard.	3
The only negative is the size of the backspace key	4
--	7
it's not oversize	4
as it is on many newer keyboards.	4
But that's not a problem for me,	7
as I am used to a smaller backspace.	7
This keyboard has the ` Wake Up ', ` Sleep ', and ` Power ' keys	2
that most Vista-capable computers support.	2
I particularly like being able to shut the system down with a keypress	2
--	7
I haven't been able to do that since my Mac days back in the late '80s!	7
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this keyboard, particularly for someone	7
who wants the essentials,	7
without all the ` media keys '	7
and other junk	7
that seem to be found on most keyboards today.	7

B0007SXGJW-0000
The thing was for a serial port	1
not a USB port and new computers don't have serial ports.	1
A bust.	7
I have an old computer upstairs	7
which I'll hook it up to so it won't be a total waste.	7

B0007SXGJW-0003
I think	7
it was just the keyboard	7
that I received,	7
but my spacebar would get stuck all the time.	0
If I pressed the spacebar,	0
the computer would register multiple spaces.	0
I am pretty sure this is not a software/driver issue,	7
I even downloaded the microsoft drivers	7
and tried different keyboards,	7
it only happens with this one.	7
And overall, the construction and materials used	0
is much inferior to the logitech	0
that I'm using now.	7
I used to be a fan of microsoft mice in the past	7
and thought	7
I'd give this a try,	7
I don't think	7
I will be buying another Microsoft peripheral again.	7

B0007SXGJW-0005
Pros :	7
Good typing feel.	3
Nice pre-programmed buttons for volume, calculator, and MyComputer.	2
Cons :	7
Cheap build : the little legs in the back	0
for tilting the keyboard break off right away.	0
The home, end, insert, etc. keys are awkwardly placed.	4
Definitely not worth more than about $ 10!	8
But	7
if you don't tilt your keyboard,	7
you might not think	7
it's bad at all.	7

B0007SXGJW-0013
Unlike many people, I just want a standard keyboard with good touch and a PS2	7
(not USB) plug.	7
Although this model has some custom keys for email, brower activation, music, etc,	2
I didn't bother with them.	7
The keys are a standard layout except for the Home/End cluster	4
which is vertical instead of horizontal.	4
That places the Insert key	4
where the Delete key usually is,	4
but it hasn't been much of a problem.	7
For the price,	8
I think	7
this is a good buy,	8
and much better than other $ 15 keyboards.	8

B0007SXGJW-0022
I bought this as a simple back up for my wireless keyboard.	7
When the batteries go out I planned to use this one.	7
I ended up	7
using this one nearly exclusively!	7
Yep its cheap and dinky,	8
but it does the job well,	7
feels good, has nice extra features,	3 2
and is CHEAP!	8

B0009VU7RG-0001
I purchased this for a new Mac Mini.	7
I do not like the key action, the key noise and the cheap feel of the keyboard.	3 6 0
I shall return it to Amazon.	7
Pros : works	7
as it should right out of the box.	7
Special feature keys	2
(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)	2
are handy.	2
Cons : noisy keys,	6
keyboard feels cheap,	3
key travel is shallow	3
and lacks	3
the quality feel	3
and quiet of every other Mac and Windows keyboard I use at home and work.	6
Verdict : Try any keyboard	7
before you purchase.	7
If you dislike a cheap feel, noisy keys or a shallow mechanical key action,	3 6
you will be dissatisfied with this keyboard.	3 6

B0009VU7RG-0003
I can not stand this keyboard.	7
I was forced to use one for a while,	7
and I decided to purchase a standard aluminum Apple keyboard with number pad	7
to save my sanity.	7
This Mac Ally keyboard is very loud and also cumbersome.	6
However, it does hold pencils and pens quite well!	2
I'm confident	7
that	7
if I were to pound on my desk,	7
the pencils would remain in the handy pencil/pen recess.	2
I gave 2 stars	7
because the keyboard does work,	7
it's just not comfortable or quiet.	3 6

B0009VU7RG-0010
This was the cheapest keyboard	8
I could find,	7
and it does work, its just really loud!	6
It sounds almost	6
like you're typing on a typewriter.	6
I was too lazy to return it.	7

B0009VU7RG-0025
This keyboard is indeed noisy,	6
but you know what?	6
I like that.	6
I also like not having to replace batteries every week.	7
The number pad on the right side of the keyboard is a clutch feature, too.	2
If you are a conventional home-row typer,	7
this keyboard will feel much more natural than the stock Mac keyboard.	3
It is used by the three kids and me,	7
and we all agree	7
that we prefer it,	7
and we rarely agree on anything.	7

B0009VU7RG-0034
I kept buying original iMac keyboards	7
and they kept breaking on me.	7
This one does not look like the original	5
but has all the keys like the original	4
except for the multimedia keys are not labeled but do work.	2 4
This one feels more like a PC keyboard	3
and it is wider	4
but it does last longer.	0
It is slim but not as slim as the iMac more like a slim PC keyboard.	5
Looks cheap but its not.	5
For the price i would buy this one any day.	8
Does not look as good as the original but last longer	5
and feels good to type in.	3

B001FB55GC-0001
When this keyboard worked,	7
it was everything	7
I had hoped for and more.	7
The keys had the perfect amount of tension,	3
the spacing was impeccable,	3 4
and the wrist rest was comfortable and stylish.	3
Also, the wireless connectivity was good for my small room.	1
But about 6 months in of light use	0
(never left my desk),	0
the S and A keys slowly started to malfunction.	0
For a keyboard this price, it is ridiculous.	8
I've switched back to a cheap $ 10 dell keyboard	7
that can be dropped and stepped on with no ill effects.	7
If you want to repurchase a keyboard every 6 months to a year,	0
then this is the keyboard for you.	7
For everyone else, stay away!	7

B001FB55GC-0008
I've had this keyboard for over a year with minor use.	7
The only issues	7
I had :	7
1.)	7
The reception was sometimes spotty in registering clicks.	1
The receptor was at ye level in the back of my desktop standing 5 feet away.	7
2.)	7
The spacebar rarely was recognized	3
when typing from the * SIDE * of the spacebar.	3
Tremendous mistake by Logitech designers.	7
3.)	7
After a year of limited use, certain keys on the upper left had corner of the KB	0
just suddenly stopped working.	0
On a positive note, Logitech Customer Service took care of my defective KB under the warranty plan	7
when the keys stopped working.	0

B001FB55GC-0013
Logitech makes the best keyboards and mice, hands down.	7
I ordered this in 2009 along with an HP keyboard to compare,	7
but there was no comparison.	7
The Logitech keyboard Had a much better build quality,	0
look and feel,	3 5
and those signature buttery smooth keys.	3
Typing on this keyboard is like velvet or down feathers or something so silky smooth.	3
But, a big but, in the end this keyboard has serious flaws.	7
It lags and is unresponsive at times,	7
it disconnects from the USB dongle	1
and needs to be re-setup,	1
And worst of all the power switch is very flimsy and no longer connects.	0
I have to jiggle and wiggle it into exactly the right position	0
to stay on.	0
Expected more from Logitech's top dollar keyboards.	8
Well, it came out 10 + years ago so not too unexpected.	7
Ive decided to chuck it and go with a much newer, cheaper, lighter version, the K360.	7
Only 24 bills,	7
and connects with my Logitech mouse to the Unifying receiver...	7

B001FB55GC-0025
This has been a great little wireless keyboard.	7
It's small	7
and I keep it on my bedside table	7
to use with my media pc.	7
I've had it for over 6 months	7
and it's still on the first set of batteries.	7
The buttons have great feel like most logitech stuff.	3
The keypad feels like a good laptop keyboard.	3
If it had a touch pad	7
it'd be the bomb.	7
It would also be nice	7
if the keys did illuminate.	2
It does feel like a quality piece in your hands, not some super cheap wireless keyboard.	0
I caught it on sale for around $ 25.	8

B001FB55GC-0040
What can I say, its about time, perfect keyboard.	7
Keys are light and easy to use,	3
layout is perfect,	4
programmable function keys are great.	2
Just wish	7
I wouldn't have waited so long	7
to purchase!	7
If your looking for a wireless keyboard, desktop or laptop,	7
this is your keyboard...	7
you will not be disappointed!!	7

B002MUYP3E-0002
I've had this keyboard for about six months	0
and the letters are wearing off of the keys.	0
I've had many keyboards over the years	7
and none have done this even after several years of heavy use.	7
The letters should be molded into the plastic.	0
Instead they 're	0
applied to the key surfaces afterwords.	0
The volume control keys are on the right side,	4
and they 're	7
activated by a function key	4
that is also only on the right side.	4
That means changing	4
the volume	4
(or muting)	7
requires the movement of both hands.	4
It's a poor design for such frequently-used keys.	4
The arrow keys are a bit too small for such often-used keys.	4
I bought the HP wireless keyboard,	7
and it has none of these problems.	7
It is larger however,	7
and it has short-stroke keys like a laptop.	7
Some may prefer the more standard keystroke	7
that the Logitech offers.	7
All-in-all, I like the cheaper HP much better.	7

B002MUYP3E-0004
Keyboard works great.	7
However, I accidentally broke the wireless usb receiver.	7
Called logitech for a replacement	7
and they said	7
it would be a 3 month wait.	7
This pretty much renders my purchase useless.	7
Its surprising	7
that a company would fail to stock such a critical, small, and easily replaceable item.	7
Do your self a favor a purchase from another company	7

B002MUYP3E-0011
I had to purchase 2 other keyboards	7
before I found this one.	7
I say	7
it is OK	7
because it is not quite as comfortable as the one	3
I was used to.	3
The space bar is long enough but not wide enough.	4
Sometimes I have to strike the space bar more than once	4
because it doesn't stand quite high enough	4
to work with my right thumb.	4
Overall I think	7
it could be a little longer	4
because the keys seem to be crowded.	4

B002MUYP3E-0017
Bought this wireless keyboard for our HTPC.	7
It is fairly light keyboard	3
and is about the size of a full size keyboard on a laptop.	5
The keys feel as good as non-wireless Logitech keyboards,	3
so I have no complaints there.	3
Also, there is no noticeable lag from the time	7
you press a key	7
and it registering on the screen.	7
We have had this keyboard for a month now	7
and have not had to change the batteries.	7
I have not verified the range for this keyboard,	1
but we keep it around 10 feet from the computer.	1
I only have a couple of minor complaints about the keyboard.	7
First, I wish	7
it had a light	7
to indicate	7
whether the NumLock is on or off.	7
Secondly, about 1 in 10 times	1
when I initially use the keyboard I have to log out and log back in	1
to get the keyboard to work.	1
I suspect	1
this may be do to the location of the RF receiver for the keyboard,	1
which is at the back of the HTPC.	1

B002MUYP3E-0050
I like these so much	7
I ordered another for work	7
to use with my laptop.	7
Unfortunately, it appears	7
Logitech is discontinuing this particular model.	7
The replacement appears to use " island " keys	7
which I dislike.	7
I like this model enough	7
that I'll probably buy a couple more refurbished units online just to keep around as spares.	7
Keyboards are largely a personal preference.	7
For me, this keyboard has the perfect size, height, tactile feel and sound, and the perfect key resistance.	3 6 4
I type faster and with fewer errors on this keyboard	3
than any I've ever used before.	7
Wireless and the batteries last a good long while.	1
Love it!	7

B00385VWKG-0001
I bought this keyboard in hopes	8 0
that the price would reflect some kind of quality.	8 0
I was severely disappointed.	8 0
The top row of number keys all stuck right out of the box.	0
The Num-lock, 7,4,1, and zero keys stopped working after 1 hour,	0
and the down arrow quit too, then the spacebar.	0
Totally frustrated.	7
I wont be replacing this one with another.	7
I'll buy a different brand.	7
Steer clear!	7

B00385VWKG-0007
This keyboard is nice,	7
the response is good	3
and the keys light up and are quite legible in darkness or low light.	2
It does not have convensional format for spacing of keys.	4
Anytime you use a non letter key	4
you'll have to make use of it's visibility	4
to see	4
where the key is on the board.	4

B00385VWKG-0010
The keyboard looks nice	5
but it has a few flaws.	7
There's no mute button,	2
some of the keys are to small.	3 4
If you have a desktop	7
that you use in a darkened room,	7
you will like this keyboard	7

B00385VWKG-0016
This keyboard is awesome,	7
the light is bright	2
and makes it easy to use in dim light or dark.	2
The only problem is	7
that the keys are so close together	4
and it is not set up like most keyboards.	4
The delete, home, end, page up and down,	4
and arrow keys are all small and squished in with the rest of the keyboard keys.	4
But it was easy to hook up	1
and works great!	1

B00385VWKG-0027
Looked all over the place for this type of LED key bourd,	7
had this almost two years now,	7
for this price and the blue letters work very good in low light,	8 2
it's a lttle small	5
and fits well on top of your desk.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0000
A full size keyboard should not cause even the biggest guy	7
to feel ` fat fingered '.	7
Also the location of some of the important keys	4
(like backspace and delete)	4
are in odd places.	4
Even the space bar is tiny.	4
I definitely would not recommend this for gaming or a lot of typing.	7
I like the backlight though.	2

B003Y7ZBDM-0003
Dad wanted a keyboard	7
he could see at night	7
without his lights on in the house other than a little desk lamp.	7
They keys are TOO close together more so than any keyboard	4
any of my family has used.	7
This didn't work	7
so we pitched	7
it and he went back to his old keyboard	7
without a light.	7
I surely wouldn't recommend this piece of work to anyone.	7
I mean what good is a keyboard	7
if some of the keys don't work?????	7
None of the lighted keyboards I checked out	7
when I bought	7
this had very good reviews	7
but for Dad I bought one anyway.	7
What a waste of time and money.	8
May God bless.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0016
This is a pretty good keyboard for the price.	8
The backlit keys look great	2 5
and there aren't any issues	7
to speak of.	7
But	7
if you want a full sized keyboard,	4
this isn't what you 're	4
looking for.	4
Not sure	7
why it's listed as full sized	7
as I think anyone	7
looking for a quality compact keyboard would be thrilled with this item.	7
Otherwise, a solid device.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0029
This keyboard is nice and bright, plug and play and easy to use.	1
The price is also right.	8
If you're a gamer like me	7
and just need a little light for your keys to find your bearings sometime,	2
this will work for you.	7
I had to take a star off	7
because they made the keyboard compact	4
and cut the size of the back/delete key.	4
This is really annoying for non gaming or word	7
processing	7
as you will miss the key often	7
if you 're	7
used to a standard keyboard.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0046
I purchased this keyboard	7
because I like to surf the web right before go to sleep	7
and usually the lights are off.	7
Even though I can type	7
without looking at the keyboard...	7
it was still a little hard to type with the lights off.	7
So I looked up some backlit keyboards	7
and saw	7
that this one had some good reviews.	7
I like the blue LED color.	2
It's bright enough to see,	2
but not too bright in the dark.	2
You can also turn the lights on and off.	2
They keyboard has a great feel,	3
but I have one complaint.	7
They say	7
it's a full size keyboard,	7
but it feels a little smaller than a full size.	4
It feels	3
like the size is between a full size keyboard and a laptop computer.	3 4
I guess	7
I just wish	4
the backspace button was a little larger...	4
I'm always	7
missing it!	7
Haha.	7
But for the price you are getting a great product	8
and I would recommend it to anyone	7
looking for a backlit keyboard.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0000
Have tried to work with this for a couple of months with my iMac Intel.	7
It is never discoverable by the computer	1
and	7
when it can be used	1
it takes some time for it to wake up	1
and provide service.	1
The help from the manufacturer is very poor	7
and I'm disgusted with them and this nasty piece of work.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0008
I got this keyboard	8
when it was discounted to $ 8.95.	8
And it's probably only worth that much.	8
It frequently looses the bluetooth connection with my MacBook Pro	1
and drops the key presses, especially with the space bar.	0
So I keep on editing what type.	7
Also key are a bit harder to press,	3
and the contact connections may not always work,	0
resulting in skipped characters on the screen.	0
There are better keyboards for the price.	8

B004HFLRUQ-0020
I bought this as a replacement for a PC keyboard I was using	7
that was way too loud.	7
This one	1
connected fine	1
and works well enough.	7
It's small and attractive.	5
My only complaint is	7
that the keys are loose	0
-	7
they kind of wobble	0
where they sit,	0
which gives it a cheapish feel,	3 0
makes the fingers a bit unsure	3
of where to sit	3
and makes using the keyboard louder	6
than it needs to be.	6

B004HFLRUQ-0025
This keyboard worked	7
as promised.	7
It easily connects to my iPad and Droidx.	1
The price is right.	8
My only complaint is the lack of a proper on/off switch.	2
I travel a lot	7
and unless I remove the batteries	7
it comes on in my suitcase	7
and I end up with dead batteries.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0029
I work on my phone,	7
so this is wonderful, i had checked apple	7
and almost spent twice the price, of course this one is plastic	8 0
but it works just great none the less. i have had mine over a year	0
and it still is working great,	0
only drawback is the on and off button is so tiny	2
that it is hard to slide,	2
but hey use	7
a pen and dont complain.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0000
I was excited about using this keyboard	7
for when I was traveling and using my tablet.	7
I liked ergonomics and the lightness	3 4
and all was well...	7
until the 3d time I tried to use it.	7
Dead.	0
Changed batteries,	0
made no difference.	0
It had not been banged around	0
and no reason for this to happen.	0
Can't recommend this item!	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0003
This keyboard is very hard to type on and will cause your wrists to ache.	3
It lays flat	3
rather than have some level of angle.	3
Also, the bluetooth connection turns off after a certain amount of inactivity,	1
which caused intermittent delays	1
while I was writing.	1
For example, I'd type a paragraph,	7
go back	7
and read it,	7
maybe think for a minute,	7
and when I went back to type again I would get a delayed reaction, sometimes for 10 or more seconds	1
until the connection would re-establish.	1
This was even more annoying	7
when surfing the web.	7
Sometimes I wouldn't be able to use my keyboard to type in my password	1
to log in to the computer, very annoying.	1
I liked the idea of not having to have a USB wireless receiver for my keyboard and mouse,	7
but the reality is	7
that this solution is too uncomfortable and unreliable.	1 3
I would not recommend this product.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0014
This is probably the most comfortable keyboard	3
I've ever used.	3
The slight curvature in the middle of the keyboard makes for a more relaxed typing position,	3
without being too exaggerated like the " split " keyboards	3
that have a gap	7
running top-to-bottom through the keyboard with an upward angle	7
that strains my wrists.	7
The slim depth of this keyboard helps keep my wrists relaxed, as well.	3
The big issue with this keyboard is	1
that it loses the bluetooth connection with my laptop on a regular basis.	1
I have to uninstall/reinstall the keyboard sometimes as often as a few times per month.	7
I don't have any problems with other bluetooth devices,	7
so I assume	7
it is something with the keyboard.	7
I don't know	7
if it is the actual keyboard or the software	1
(drivers).	7
If this keyboard wasn't so comfortable to type on,	3
I would have sent it back.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0024
A beautiful keyboard	5
which if you get it for a deal	8
is well worth it.	7
I take it with me on vacation	7
to use with my bluetooth tablet or phone.	7
One could put a bluetooth adapter in a netbook	7
and get a much more comfortable keyboard.	3
I have not ever liked the Microsoft keyboards	7
which were contoured	7
and had a break in the middle between the G and the H.	7
I learned typing in high school	7
and those keyboards slow me down.	7
This one fits the way	3
your fingers would naturally sit.	3
Each row is on a bit of a curve upward at the ends	4
just as all my Logitech keyboards have been.	7

I initially bought a cheap keyboard	7
(the Anker)	7
and I received a defective unit.	7
After returning it I decided	7
that it was worth another $ 15 for a high quality product.	7
I absolutely do not regret it.	7
I've had zero problems	1
with pairing and connecting this keyboard,	1
and the key feel is very good for such a thin keyboard.	3
The build	0
quality seems very good as well.	0
My only complaint is	2
that some flip-out feet would be nice,	2
but those always seem to break anyway.	7

Pros :	7
It's cheap and a little quieter than a regular keyboard.	8 6
Cons :	7
It's not silent.	6
It died less than 5 months	0
after I bought it.	0
The Rosewill website helpfully says	7
the warranty is " Repair Only ".	7
Unfortunately, the postage charges mean	7
it's not worth sending this back to Rosewill for repair.	7
I would write more but really,	7
it's a keyboard	7
that's a little quieter than others.	6
It hasn't changed my life, solved general relativity	7
or provided answers about the meaning of life.	7
It died	0
and isn't worth replacing.	7
Even Tolstoy couldn't do much with that.	7

About the only thing this keyboard has going for it is its price.	8
I was looking for a thin, basic keyboard	7
that wouldn't make	7
me arch my wrists	7
when I type.	7
Keyboard seemed to occasionally miss button presses	3
and was just generally fairly inaccurate.	7
Replaced it with a slightly more expensive K120 from Logitech	7
and find it to be much better,	7
even though it is a little thicker with more travel in the keys.	7
I also have a Logitech solar K750	7
that is even thinner than the Rosewell	7
and I also much prefer its typing characteristics and accuracy,	7
though it is much more expensive and not in the same league.	7

That's all	6
you hear with this keyboard	6
- a loud ticking/clacking noise as you type.	6
It works well,	7
but	7
if you want something quiet,	6
this isn't it.	6
It's also somewhat bulky,	3
but for the price	8
you get	8
what you pay for.	7
It works, no bells or whistles.	7

It is my own fault	7
but the only thing	7
I wish for on this	7
is some media buttons such as volume,	2 4
since I am using it in a set up with a macbook pro	7
and dont want to have to reach to my laptop	7
to control the volume,	7
but that wasn't in the design.	7
It feels a bit cheap	0
but what do	8
you expect at the price.	8
In general functionality is good for a simple small chiclet keyboard.	7

B006CSKLO4-0026
For $ 10, this isn't bad at all.	8
Very nice keyboard with very responsive keys.	3
They're kinda loud,	6
but meh I don't care.	7
I spilt water on it a few days ago	0
and It's still working perfectly so	0
that's pretty awesome. 5 stars.	7
