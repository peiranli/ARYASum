B00008V40C-0022
I have never hated a product more than this one.	5
It is so loud	4
that it hurts your ears.	4
The dirt is just blown around	7
and you spend all of your time revacuuming spots.	7
I am getting rid of it.	5
Don't waste your money!!!	5

B00008V40C-0040
This stick vac is powerful alright.	7
The problem is	5
that the opening on the bottom of the unit is too small.	5
Forget about corners,	5
unless you are positioned right over	5
what you intend to vacuum	5
it won't get sucked up.	7
It is way too loud and blows all of the dog hair and dirt all over the floor.	4 7
I am returning it an	5
getting something else!	5

B00008V40C-0053
The Power Stick has great suction	7
but the opening is only about 3 inches wide	5
so it takes longer to clean a room then	5
it would with some other products.	5
It does a good job though with cat hair and bits of kitty litter.	5
The noise	4
that others complain about	4
doesn't bother me but my cat runs and hides	4
whenever I turn it on.	5
It's very lightweight	8
but I wish	0
the handle was a little longer.	0
I find myself stooping a bit	3
when I use	5
it and I'm only 5 ' 4 ''.	5

B00008V40C-0067
I love this vacuum for quick clean ups,	5
of which I have many.	5
I have two dogs and a cat	5
so there's always hair and litter somewhere.. this is a quick alternative	5
to pulling out the big vacuum.	5
It's very light weight,	8
works well	5
and has a nice long cord.	3
The only downside is	5
that unlike the big vacuum, there's no skinny attachment to get into the corners.. but it's a small downside,	0
I just gab the dust buster or broom to compensate.	5
I am able to vacuum more often	5
(my `` big '' vacuum	5
is really big and powerful	5
and heavy..)	5
and more quickly, so all in all	5
it helps trendmously.	5

B00008V40C-0081
It works.	5
Strong power for a small device.	7
I bought it for my laminate floors	5
because I researched	5
that you should not use a vacuum with a beater bar on these floors.	5
I just installed the floors	5
and wanted to protect them.	5
As far as loud, yeah it's pretty loud, but nothing unbearable.	4
I think	5
some people can be just too sensitive.	5
Probably not louder than a regular vacuum.	4
But I bought it for the power.	7
I want it to work and not be weak.	7
So far, it delivers.	7
Great for the price.	6

B0001WW2F8-0009
I have had this vacuum for approximately 4 months	5
and it has been nothing but trouble.	5
It does have excellent suction however,	7
I spend more time replacing the belt	1
or taking the entire thing apart to dislodge a clog in the tubes	1
that consists of nothing larger than lint and hair.	5
When the tubes get clogged	5
(which is very often)	5
the only way	5
you can tell	5
is	5
that instead of sucking the dirt into the canister it blows it all over the room.	5
This is the worst experience with an appliance	5
I have ever had.	5
I will NEVER buy another Bissell.	5

B0001WW2F8-0017
Well I have had this vaccum for just over a month	1
and it has died on me.	1
I was using it	5
and the brush on the inside stopped spinning	1
(the clear front allows you to see the brush	5
moving	5
while it is vaccuming,	5
to see the dirt	5
I suppose)	5
and an awful burning rubber smelled came from it.	5
I checked all over for clogs or something	5
wrapped around the inside	5
but found nothing.	5
Also it is very loud	4
compared to my old vaccum.	5
Until now the noise was my only complaint.	4
I need to get another one	5
and it won't be a bissell.	5

B0001WW2F8-0025
I should start by saying	5
that my last	5
(and only)	5
vacuum	5
before this was a canister.	5
Maybe I shouldn't expect this to perform as well on hard floor, I don't know.	5
This cleaned the carpet really well and	7
-- like the other reviewers said	5
--	5
pulled up a shocking amount of crud and dust.	7
The hardwood was another matter, though.	5
It seemed to do an almost adequate job on small crummy stuff,	7
but would not pick up anything rice krispy size ir bigger.	7
As a mother of 4 small kids, I need a vacuum	5
that will pick cereal bits and other food crumbs.	5
This also performed better on the tile and vinyl floors that on the hardwood.	7
I would not recommend this	5
if your house	5
(like mine)	5
is mostly hardwood.	5
If you have wall-to-wall carpet in most of the house, though,	5
this would be a good choice.	5

B0001WW2F8-0045
Good vacuum.	5
Easy assembly with just one screw.	3
Not as noisy as the Hoover monster it replaced, good tools	4 0
that really work on upolstry.	0
Real long cord gets around the house.	3
It's fun	5
to watch the little red	5
a green light tell you	0
when the floor is clean.	0
Filters?	0
I guess	0
we got	0
ta have them now,	0
but they do need attention.	0
This was definitely a good purchase so far...	5

B0001WW2F8-0073
I love this vacuum.	5
It's not too noisy	4
and it does a great job.	7
The dirt sensor works so well.	0
Usually, I just vacuum along,	5
making sure to get the visible dirt.	5
With the dirt sensor, I know	0
I'm getting the carpet clean.	0
I couldn't believe	5
how much dirt I got out of the carpets the first time	5
I used it!	5
I also like how well it fluffs up the pile of the carpet.	5

B0009RF824-0007
This little vacuum would be great	5
if it ACTUALLY vacuumed up anything.	7
Does a poor job on my wood floors, my old fashioned broom does a better job.	7
As for carpeting, doesn't pick up anything.	7
And pet hair?	7
Forget it.	5
A big waste of money.	5
I'd rate	5
it zero stars	5
if I could,	5
I 'm	5
tossing it.	5

B0009RF824-0013
I had this vacuum for 2 years	5
and it still works,	5
but I can't use it.	5
The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -	1
so I have been	5
using it duct	5
taped together,	5
which was ok	5
until the area	1
where the bottom connects to the body also broke,	1
rendering it useless.	1
I am going to have to add it to a landfill	5
and buy a new one.	5
I am disappointed	5
since it was nice and light - good for carrying up to our loft and small enough	8
to fit in the closet and powerful enough	7
to clean up cat hair.	7

B0009RF824-0018
This is the second Shark stick vac	5
I have owned.	5
My first one worked great for about 5 years.	5
Towards the end of its run it wouldn't suck very well	5
and was consistently getting clogged.	5
In the end the motor burned out.	5
This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors	5
so we purchased another one.	5
Well it seem to be that	5
after only using this product for over a month, Im	1
having the same issues with it already.	1
I guess	5
when you purchase	5
this stick vac	5
you are	5
taking your chances.	5
Good Luck!!	5

B0009RF824-0021
My wife finds her new Shark Vacuum better	5
then the first one we purchased.	5
It is quite,	4
and seems to vacuum better then the first one.	7
Also the retractable cord is a plus.	3
For the price we think	6
this was a great buy.	6
Also the shipping time was great,	5
we received the product a couple of days early.	5
Have a great week.	5

B0009RF824-0027
Finally, somebody out there got it right.	5
A small, light-weight appliance that can do a big job.	8
I was getting tired of lugging heavy, cumbersome vacuums up and down the stairs	5
and thought	5
I'd look for a more practical alternative.	5
I found one in the Shark.	5
I recommend it highly.	5
From carpet to floor, it does an excellent job.	5
Clean the filter regularly and it this little vacuum won't let you down.	0

B0009WRKSO-0072
I recently bought an Altima Model 2981BVZ.	5
This vacuum is the most flawed piece of machinery	5
I have ever had the misfortune	5
of using.	5
Every 3 minutes I have to clean the foam filter.	0
I clean more out of the foam filter	5
than I do out of the dust cup.	5
The hose attachments have very little power.	0 7
I am sadly disappointed in the quality.	1

B0009WRKSO-0104
Too bulky, cord is unusually stiff and tangles are impossible to remove.	3
Mine picks up animal hair	7
but it does spit out a lot of dirt.	7
The attachments are not useful.	0
You do have to clean out filters often,	0
but they're filters,	0
you should want them clean.	0
Would I buy another like it,	5
heck no!	5
Eureka s are not what they used to be.	5

B0009WRKSO-0110
This vacuum picks up very well...	7
until of course the filters get blocked	0
and then you have to wash them out.	0
Oh yes.. and after about 1 year of use the back wheel fell off -	1
haven't been able to find replacement part	5
to keep the wheel on.	5
Gave up and just bought a Dyson Dc-17.	5

B0009WRKSO-0116
I love this vacuum!	5
I have a cat	5
and it gets all the hair.	5
The claw is a great attachment.	0
The only problem is the duster,	0
which doesn't spin	0
and keeps falling off	0
while I'm cleaning.	0
Just put it in a closet	5
and keep cleaning...	5
this is a great buy!	5

B0009WRKSO-0123
I, too, bought the yellow Walmart model 2981BVZ	5
after my 10 year old Hoover Windtunnel died.	5
I must say	5
I am impressed with this vacuum	5
even though it only cost about $ 80,	6
compared with almost $ 300 for my Hoover.	5
It cleans remarkably well, as well	7
as my old Hoover did,	5
it is quieter than my Hoover,	4
the telescoping dust brush DOES work,	0
and it is so convenient	3
to empty the dust cup	3
without having to clean the filter each time.	3
True, it isn't self-propelled,	3
but it is relatively light for its size and fairly easy to push around.	8 3
And the Turbo Paw works absolutely great, especially on stairs.	0
The only minor flaw	5
I experienced is,	5
as others have noted,	5
the extension wand falls off	5
when bumped,	5
but I am working on a fix for this	5
and in the meantime, it doesn't detract from the cleaning power of the vacuum.	7
I love it.	5

B000BXKIE4-0018
While the suction is very good,	7
the `` power nozzle '' is a piece of junk.	5
We've had two now	1
and they quit working	1
just after the warranty runs out	1
(90 days).	5
A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service.	2
E-mails get you nowhere.	2
We will never buy another eletrolux product.	5
Made in China says	5
it all!	5

B000BXKIE4-0035
Had this vacuum 2 years.	5
It died	5
while I was vacuuming.	5
Pros : is	5
it is quieter than my old hoover.	4
Cons :	5
the cord is too short	3
and didn't retract well.	5
Bags fill up quickly	0
as they are small and expensive.	6 0
It is hard to control	3
when pulling.	3
The floor attachment is to big.	0
The attachments are easily knocked off the wand.	0
I wouldn't recommend this vacuum.	5

B000BXKIE4-0041
The vacuum works really well to clean medium to low carpet in my apartment!	7
It is quiet	4
so I can clean at night	4
and not disturb my neighbor up and below my room.	4
The only problem	3
I found so far	5
(using for 2 months)	5
is	3
that it doesn't turn very well.	3
You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum	3
to turn the unit.	3

B000BXKIE4-0056
I like this electrolux ;	5
it works well	5
and it cleans thoroughly.	7
It is a little tricky	3
learning how to manuver it ;	3
it's not as easy as the old traditional electrolux	3
I've used for years.	5
It takes a little	3
getting used to it ;	3
that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.	5
The handle is a little thick and slightly difficult to use.	3
The machine works very well	5
and the house feels so clean	5
after I use it.	5
Electrolux products are excellent ;	5
I used my last electrolux for over 30 years	5
and it's still running.	5

B000BXKIE4-0077
Everything written in the reviews	5
is true.	5
I wanted to go back to a canister	5
and was looking around at Sears	5
and saw this model	5
clearanced at $ 231.	6
I was a little nervous	5
buying it	5
because I had done zero research on the product.	5
I've used electrolux in the past	5
and always liked it.	5
I've also used Kirby and Hoover uprights.	5
I am thrilled with the electrolux.	5
It's powerful, lightweight and maneuvers beautifully under beds, around corners and tight spots.	3 8 7
For the price I paid,	6
I am beyond excited.	6

B003CUQJZK-0007
I had our first Miele 25 years	5
and had to replace only	5
when the universal bags didn't provide a tight seal	5
and kept coming unattached.	5
I had expected at least as good from this model.	5
It was not to be.	5
I can not even use the power head	0
because no one can get it off or on.	0
The issue has become more of a problem	5
as time goes on.	5
At first it was difficult to remove	0
but now it won't even attach to the wand.	0
The design of this newer version is poor	5
and certainly wasn't trialed	5
before it went into manufacturing.	5
The tools were previously stored inside the canister	0
and were easily accessed.	0
Now they sit on top,	5
are in the way	5
and cheaply made.	1
The support for the wand	0
is now on the opposite end of the carrying	0 3
handle making it impossible to carry unless the wand is carried separately.	3
Difficult when carrying up and down stairs.	3
Yes, it does a good job	7
picking up dog hair	7
but that's the only thing	5
that performs as promised.	5

B003CUQJZK-0017
My wife and I	5
(in our 60s)	5
bought this Titan after all the positive reviews.	5
We have found	5
that it is quite heavy	8
to move around and constantly overturns	8 3
because of its balance.	3
It can not remove much from oriental carpets,	7
and the hard floor tool moves animal hair around instead of collecting it.	5
I'm going to sell ours	5
and go back to Kenmore.	5

B003CUQJZK-0026
After having other vacuum cleaners	5
only last for less than 2 years I am hoping	5
that this will last at least 5.	5
If it does	5
I would give it 4 stars.	5
Positive :	5
It's very light, quiet and easy to move.	4 8 3
Negative : The cable is too short,	3
the electric power head for carpet not very wide and powerful and it tips over easily.	0 3
The utensil tray is so-so.	0
Changing the length of the tube requires some fiddling.	0
At almost $ 600 I would have expected better,	6
especially considering	5
that Miele sells comparable units in Europe for $ 300 -	5
$ 400.	5

B003CUQJZK-0048
So far this Miele Titan Canister is	5
just what I was looking for.	5
I am very excited about the outcome of this new purchase.	5
I read a lot of reviews	5
and chose this product over others.	5
It has really good suction	7
and is quiet.	4
I have wide pine floors with area rugs,	5
and the parquet floor brush and the power brush do a really nice job.	0
In addition, it is light and easy to carry around	8 3
-- and it picks up kitty litter!	5

B003CUQJZK-0069
This vac may not be for everyone.	5
It has it's shortcomings	5
but I believe	5
that's because we Americans expect a lot of convenience in our products.	5
The bag hold very little,	0
it has 3 wheels	3
and is unsteady,	3
the on-off controls are only on the base,	3
the cord is short, NOW...	3
... the suction settings are very convenient,	5
the various attachments really do their job,	0
it's quiet,	4
and best of all this vac does the job	5
that it was intended to do,	5
it sucks like no other vacuum	7
that I have ever had.	7
Before using it the first time I vacuumed my whole house with my old vac	5
and then proceeded	5
to use the Miele.	5
Wow, I was shocked at how much dirt, dust, animal hair, etc.	7
that it picked up.	7
I love this vacuum	5
and would have no other.	5
I honestly can't say enough good about this vacuum.	5
I'd recommend it over and over again as long as I also shared the shortcomings.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0001
I ordered the Hoover handheld canister vacuum	5
because the review on it was good.	5
I paid extra to get it the next day,	2
which it did.	2
When I opened the box of tools several of them were missing.	0
I emailed Amazon	2
but never got a reply	2
regarding what can be done	2
to replace the missing and essential tools.	2
After paying over $ 100	6
to get this vacuum I	6
would expect some sort of reply from someone.	2
I am very disappointed in Amazon and Hoover for their poor quality control.	2
I would have returned the whole thing	5
but the vac works fine, I just had to work with some old parts	5
so it could do	5
what I boulght it for.	5
I guess	5
the word quality and customer service no longer exist.	2 1

B005ZFUKG4-0004
This vacuum works great	5
but it is so loud I can not even get through vacuuming my tile floors.	4
I even tried putting ear plugs in to vacuum with it,	4
but it still hurts my ears.	4
I am going to have to return it	5
and find something	5
that runs more quietly.	5
Any suggestions out there?	5

B005ZFUKG4-0006
I love this vacuum -	5
it is light -	8
it is powerful	7
and works wonderfully.	5
Great to get in small corners, counters, furniture.	3
There is one small -	5
could be come major problem.	5
The plastic extensions tend to shatter	0 1
if dropped onto a hard surface.	0 1
One of the extensions barely fits	0
and I am afraid	0
that this could become unusable very soon.	0 1
It is a huge disappoint	5
as I love it otherwise!	5
Otherwise I would give it 5 stars -	5
but I am afraid	5
I may not be able to use it before long.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0010
I have my own cleaning business	5
and was looking for a vacuum	5
that would do everything	5
but unfortunately I just couldn't find it.	5
So in order to go from hard floors to carpet I had to invest in two different vacs.	5
I love my Shark for Carpet	5
and originally purchased a backpack vacuum	5
which only lasted me two years	5
before the motor went out.	5
I did not want another backpack	5
because it was just too heavy	5
but liked the concept	5
because I don't like canister vacs.	5
Based on reviews I went with this one for $ 75.	6
The suction is amazing	7
and does	5
exactly what I wanted it too.	5
I only have two drawbacks on this vac, one	5
I'm tall	3
and the wand is a bit short for me	3
but there's only a few jobs	5
I have	5
that I need this little beauty	5
for so it's perfect.	5
Brush head is small,	0
my old one doesn't fit on this	0
and was twice as wide.	0
Going to see	5
if they sell additional attachments to suit my needs.	0

B005ZFUKG4-0014
I needed a small vacuum	5
to complete cleaning more efficiently and easily.	5
My old one quit and	5
as I had added a new motor to it last year,	5
I decided to look for a new one.	5
I looked at every small but powerful vacuum	5
I could find in stores and on line.	5
Because I live in a rural area,	5
I could not find the Hoover	5
I selected.	5
I wanted to lift and check the convenience	5
of handling it before purchase	5
but could not at that	5
time so I ordered it from Amazon.	5
I was delighted with the handling of this vacuum,	3
it is so easy to maneuver.	3
I had also wanted to be sure	7
it had good suction and the ability	7
to clean really well	7
and was well satisfied.	7

B007LZ9LV6-0005
At first it was a great vacuum.	5
Then the motor became unbearably loud.	4
I used it in an enclosed room	4
and my ears started ringing	4
because it was so loud.	4
Eventually I started listening to my iPod	5
whenever I vacuumed.	5
Then the engine completely stopped vacuuming.	1
There is an 800 number	2
I have to call to get them to replace it	2
but I'm afraid	2
they may charge me shipping +	2
I don't have the big giant box anymore.	5
They want you to take it to one of 5 vacuum repairers in NY	2
and I'm not going all the way to Sea Girt Long Island	2
to have them repair it.	2

B007LZ9LV6-0013
It does have plenty of power and suction.	7
It is light weight and easy to maneuver.	8 3
The bad is that	5
if you have the new shag style thick pyle carpet	3
then you will see how hard this vacuum is to use.	3
You have to hold it at a very uncomfortable angle	3
since there is not height adjustment.	3
The height adjustment is the angle	3
you put on he handle.	3
That's just weird for me.	5
So you have to have the right handle angle combination for it to not hang up on the thick carpet.	3
I am in the process	5
of trying to return it to the company	5
I bought it from as his is a lot of money to spend on something	6
that isn't easily usable on my carpet.	6 3

B007LZ9LV6-0020
I really like	5
that its smaller than my old Bistle & LOVE	3
that I have no longer need	0 3
to wrap up the cord.	0 3
I bought	5
as I have two cats.	5
I have a wooden trip along the base of my carpet	5
seperating it from the wall,	5
this unit claimed	3
to get down deep in the ridges yet I dont see that happening.	3
I went over an area with this one then with my old one	5
and there was still stuff	5
coming up off carpet.	5
I dont love it as much	5
as I thought but do like the idea of its multiple filters	0
and hope	5
that with more uses it willl keep my floors clean.	5
I will be trying the pet tool attachment soon,	0
that should be alot better than just the hose on regular vacuums.	0

B007LZ9LV6-0048
Out of the box I liked the physical feel of the vacuum,	1
all the components are well built.	1
The filter and dirt compartment is easily detachable	0 3
and cleaned.	0 3
The vacuum	5
itself is compact and easily	5
stored.	5
The electric cord is retractable	0
and is conveniently	3
hidden when not in use.	3
The various attachments are of good quality	0 1
and attach easily to the vacuum.	0 3
The vacuum itself has strong suction power	7
and is able to quickly pick up dirt and other grime off the floor and walls.	7
One thing	5
I dislike about this vacuum	5
is	5
that it emits a strong odor every-time	1
I'm done	1
using it.	1

B007LZ9LV6-0065
Very agile and light to maneuver.	8 3
High powered suction + hepa filter = ultra clean rug.	7
For this price point, great value for quality you get.	6 1
Extremely pleased with Panasonic's vac.	5
Thank you.	5

B00A7D2L84-0004
The floor accessory fell apart and	0 1
when I tried to reattach it the handle shattered.	0 1
This vacuum is cheaply made,	1
doesn't have strong suction	7
and all accessories are constructed of flimsy plastic.	0 1
Not a quality machine and not worth the price.	6 1
JUNK!!!!	5

B00A7D2L84-0007
After a few times of use, the plastic	1
that connects the telescopic wand to the handle	1
cracked	1
and broke.	1
Gluing	5
it failed to hold it	5
and eventually it broke off	1
rendering it totally useless.	1
Samsung is a good company,	5
but clearly they used cheap plastic on this area	1
because a search on Google revealed some others	5
who had the same problem.	5
I have contacted customer care	2
and they have promised	2
to get back to me in 2 business days.	2
Not so sure	5
if they will fix it for free,	5
because someone in Customer Care told me they don't fix it for free	2
if it has a physical damage.	2

B00A7D2L84-0014
Overall a great product but 2 problems :	5
1. like many other reviews, plastic on the telescopic pole is not strong enough	1
and broke.	1
Still cleaning, but have to always pay attention not to definitely break it.	5
2	5
The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use.	4
My kids leave the room	5
when I'm getting close...	5
That wasn't an issue at the beginning,	5
actually it was quiet but now it's very annoying.	4
Samsung is working on it right now, no vaccum cleaner for 2 weeks, still waiting...	2
Will keep	5
you posted	5

B00A7D2L84-0017
Pros -	5
It's light and easy to handle.	8
Picks up cat hair and kitty litter easily.	7
Cons -	5
Wish the handle would stay upright instead of falling over	3
when I release it.	5
Also, sometimes the kitty litter catches below the canister	5
and falls out	5
when I go to empty it.	5
Neither is a deal breaker for me.	5

B00A7D2L84-0020
Every time	5
when I use this vacuum I love it more and more.	5
I was a little bit in shock	5
when I opened the box	5
and I saw the brush.	5
It had the size more than I had expected.	5
I was concerned	5
that It would be heavy.	8
However, the power of the vacuum and its design take care of it :	7
it pushes the brush itself.	3
It is easy to move because of the adjustable wheels on the side of the brush.	3
It fits under my Quin bed.	5
The sides " wrapped " with protective rubber like rim	1
which prevents wearing and tearing the plastic parts on the brush	1
and bumping and scratching furniture.	1
The suction is excellent and adjustable to my needs.	7

This vacuum was good for the first few months	5
except that hair never gets in the dust bin	5
but all wraps around the brush	3
and is very difficult to be taking off all the time.	3
NOW only seven months after I bought it the brush doesn't turn anymore so is no longer any good for the carpet.	0 1
I will never buy another Hoover product...	5
EVER!	5
I have not yet tried the company for help so	5
but plan to try soon.	5

I was happy with this vacuum for the most part	5
until it quit working.	1
The brush needs to be cleaned out almost every time	3
you use it	3
because all hair gets tangles	3
and stuck to the brush bristles.	3
I have cleaned the filter twice,	0 3
and I empty the canister twice during each use.	0
The vacuum recently overheated and the motor stopped working.	1
After cleaning the filters again	5
and letting the vacuum sit unused for 24 hours,	5
the motor seems to be working.	5
Now the vacuum will no longer sit flat on the floor	1
while in use, it stays tilted	1
and therefore can't vacuum anything off the floor.	1
It says	5
it has a 5 year warranty,	2
but the closest repair shop is a two hour drive away.	2
I haven't been able to vacuum for two weeks,	5
and I'm EXTREMELY frustrated!	5
If I have to spend $ 100 in gas	5
to drive to a repair shop,	5
I suppose	5
I may as well buy a new vacuum.	5
I guess	5
I should've paid for the Dyson.	5
Uggh.	5

I did a lot of research	5
before buying this vacuum.	5
Dyson always has the best review	5
but it's too expensive for me.	5
This one seems to be somewhat light-weight	8
and have powerful suction.	7
However, it's dispointing.	5
The suction is pretty powerful.	7
However, it's very heavy.	8
Way more heavier than I expected.	8
And it's not very steerable.	3
The host is short	0
and takes a lot of strength	0 3
to stratch it.	0 3
The dust bin spins dirt around for my first use.	0 1
However, it can't spin anything after second use.	0 1
I'd suggest spend a little more	5
to get a Dyson.	5

I have had this vacuum for 3 months now.	5
Overall very pleased!	5
It is light weight and easy to maneuver.	8 3
The transition from carpet to hard wood floors is smooth.	3
I have a 3 bedroom home with a small dog	5
and I vacuum at least once a week.	5
The dirt canister usually has to be emptied one or twice	0
before entire house is done	0
but it is no a problem.	0
The only reason	5
i am not giving 5 stars	5
is due to attachments...	0
to use,	5
the user must disconnect from one source	0
and reconnect into new outlet.	0
It is a extra step but not a deal breaker.	5
It is an exceptional value for the price.	6

B00B7871DS-0203
Excellent vacuum and good price.	6
Has more than sufficient suction.	7
I reused a wide and narrow nossel accessory.	0
It only comes with a single narrow attachment.	0
Only downside, excellent otherwise	5
