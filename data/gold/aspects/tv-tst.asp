I have owned this TV for about 10 months	5
and am currently looking to replace it.	5
The sound is TERRIBLE.	8
Even though the volume goes to 100.	8
The actual sounds tops out around 25	8
(the rest is for show).	5
I tried hooking up external speakers,	8
but it just amplifies the static & makes the problem worse.	8
The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing	4
(fuzzy).	4
Also DISH Networks universal remote is NOT compatible with this set.	3
So plan on keeping 2	5
around if using DISH.	5
Finally...	5
Check out MAGNAVOX's own website.	2
They don't even offer support for this TV.	2
Should say something about the quality.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0008
If you're lookng for an inexpensive HDTV,	6
stay away from this one.	6
Spend the extra money	5
and get a good TV.	5
The sound on this is horrendous.	8
I have a 10 year old CRT television with much better sound than this.	8
Don't even bother with the stereo sound	8
because it drowns out all the voices in movies.	8

B000AB2ZDE-0013
I've had this set for a few years	5
and have had only one major problem with it.	5
That problem is with the magnitude of the volume.	8
The sound quality isn't so great, either,	8
but sometimes the volume is so low	8
that you can barely hear it,	8
even if the volume is turned all the way up.	8
To be fair,	5
part of the problem is with my cable service	5
(at & t ; Uverse),	5
which uses STB boxes	5
that emit lower sound levels than others	5
I 've	5
used in the past	5
(mainly Comcast).	5
However,	5
it's always had this problem, regardless of the STB box used,	5
and I don't have this problem with STB's connected to other televisions.	5
It's really disappointing,	5
because otherwise, this would be a nice, little television.	5
I've even	5
tried hooking it up	5
using different connections,	5
but the problem persists.	5
Because of this problem, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0015
I can't speak for its longevity,	5
because it is a recent purchase,	5
but I found this tv on sale for under $ 200	6
and it is exactly what I wanted for our second tv in the bedroom.	5
Picture and sound are both acceptable	8 4
when hooked up straight to a cable line	1
without digital or HD cable.	5
I refuse to pay for HD	5
when all I plan to watch	5
is the news and Leno!	5
Set up was extremely easy and the remote is simple to use.	3
Simply plug it in	3
and tune to a channel.	3
It gets 4 stars	5
because I don't think its worth the price offered here,	6
but for what I paid its perfect.	6

B000AB2ZDE-0021
I bought one of these last Summer	5
to watch	5
while running on my treadmill.	5
It's great for casual TV watching.	5
I doubt	5
it's the best LCD TV out there,	5
but I can find nothing offensive about it	5
and I can watch it for hours.	5
Typicially I run the sound through my stereo system	8
and avoid the use of the speakers altogether,	8
which as others have pointed out are weak.	8
The surprise came	5
when my eight year old computer monitor became unuseable	1
and I was able to use this little TV for a computer monitor on a temporary basis.	1 3
It is a better computer monitor, in my opinion,	5
than many 15 '' built for the purpose LCD computer monitors.	5
I was able to use it for telecommuting all day for several days.	5
So, for a good if not great TV and a rather nice backup computer monitor, this to me is a good deal at the price.	6
But, do yourself a favor and if at all possible buy a multi-year service contract.	5

B001TA6CAM-0005
I wish more people waited 6 months to review.	5
We bought this TV last fall	5
and we loved it.	5
Great price, good picture, easy to install with Netflix.	4 6 0 3
We had read about some Toshiba power problems	5
and wondered	5
if that would be us.	5
Well, guess what?	5
It started to shut off on its own in May.	3
Then it wouldn't shut off.	3
Then it started shutting on and off repeatedly over and over.	3
It gets progressively worse with time.	5
We can do nothing with it at this point.	5
I'm pretty sure	5
Toshiba is going to do to me	2
what it seems to do to everyone	2
who calls -	2
they act	2
like they 've	2
never heard of it,	2
even though there are forums	5
everywhere mentioning this issue -	5
including Toshiba's own forum.	5
Got a great price,	6
but can't do this once a year.	5
Better to spend $ 600 on a better brand	5
than to throw $ 300 a year at this one.	5

B001TA6CAM-0011
Just got the TV.	5
Picture and sound are nice.	8 4
Its in a bedroom sized family room.	5
There is a slight hum from the TV	8
(I double checked with everything else off).	5
At low volumes its more noticible.	8
Its a common problem just do a search	5
on humming for the model.	8
If you turn backlight all the way down it gets better.	8
Also, I did notice	5
while watching an action movie	5
(Swordfish)	5
the sound did not always keep up.	8
Its a very slight gap in sound almost like	8
when they just delete a bad word out	5
and dont replace it with anything else	5
(not the case on this movie).	5
It happened a couple of times	5
and I dont have a high definition cable box yet.	5
It may not happen	5
if i use a HDMI cable?	5
Its a decent TV for the money but the hum is an issue.	5

B001TA6CAM-0014
Picture is great...	4
But...	5
when I turn up the bass the body of the TV	8
vibrates.	8
It vibrates to the point of I	8
had to turn off the TV speakers	8
and use external sound system.	8
If you're buying this unit online do	5
n't throw the box away!	5
You may need to ship it back.	5
I returned my first unit back to the store	5
to exchange my TV	5
and saw four other open box units.	5
I'm just putting two and two together.	5

B001TA6CAM-0017
This is a great tv.	5
Sound and picture quality are very satisfactory.	8 4
You have different sound and picture settings for different purposes,	8 4
gaming, movie, sports etc..	5
Since the frame is also black,	7
it seems larger than 32 '' at first sight :D.	7
There is only one problem	5
which is rare.	5
When you try to switch the input	1 3
(from HDMI to cable etc.),	5
the screen goes black.	1 3
In that case you should shut down the TV	5
and then turn it on.	5
That 's	5
why I gave 4 stars.	5
Otherwise, it is great.	5
We have been	5
using it for 7 months	5
and we are very happy.	5

B001TA6CAM-0029
This is our first experience with an HDTV.	5
So far, so good.	5
THe picture is good quality.	4
We were surprised to find	5
that even movies made decades ago,	5
look much better on HDTV.	5
There were a lot of menus and setups	3
involved when we first got it.	3
That was a little daunting.	3
Overall, we're very happy with the television.	5

B004HYG9V4-0004
DO NOT BUY! this SONY Bravia ` Smart ' TV...	5
it is a piece of JUNK!	5
I have never had to return a purchase before but this time...	5
I did the very next day!	5
The paper Manual and	5
(built in)	5
iManual are crap,	5
the Yahoo! widgets do not work,	0
the wireless connectivity is 802. 11b...	1
which is TOO SLOW to stream HD video...	1
: This is supposed to be an HD TV right?	5
Oh, also my TV started emitting a Very High Pitched Scream...	8
which in my bedroom is NOT a good thing!	8
The software and apps built into this TV	0 3
are difficult to use and setup	0 3
(` difficult ' is	0 3
being generous because I usuallly like the design and attention to detail of Sony products).	0 3
This piece of Junk costs $ 650	6
although that won't last very long...	5
I notice	5
Amazon has a ton of these ` used ' for sale for $ 500...	6
DO NOT BUY!	5

B004HYG9V4-0012
Picture quality great,	4
picture not affected by sunlight, picture angle great ; sound not good without supplimentary speakers ; not enough sound and audio inputs and outputs ; Internet streaming	8 1 4
is constantly buffering, all except Netflix, Did they even test this TV	1 0
before putting it on the street?	5
I'll have to buy a Roku for this TV.	5
I NEVER get buffering	1
when using Roku! ;	1
I saw a great review for this model on CNET,	5
no longer a trusted source ;	5
I can change channels for cable and airway channels on the supplied remote, but not satelite?,	3
I will now have three remotes for this TV	3
including Roku!	3
No longer a Sony fan. : (	5

B004HYG9V4-0015
A nice quality TV in the usual Sony tradition.	5
Plenty of ports and settings	1 0
to satisfy most everyone.	1 0
Easy hookups to audio and satellite sources.	1 3
However... many people like	5
myself bought it for the internet, Skype and web content	1
which are pathetic.	1
I have both wired and wireless access	1
and Skype is essentially worthless - slow to load, buggy and poor picture quality	1
when it does actually get a connection.	1
Web content is equally bad	1
and the choices are minimal.	1
Get a Roku or Netflix box	0
and avoid the Sony apps at all costs.	0
The `` Econ '' mode and presence sensor are annoying	5
and were immediately turned off.	5

B004HYG9V4-0030
This TV looks very good	7
and the price is even better.	6
The built in WiFi makes it even better	1
if you were going to have to purchase the adapter.	5
The on-screen menu/options is quite nice	0
and the internet apps work as expected.	0
I especially enjoy the Pandora app.	0
I'll post back later	5
if I have any issues with the TV.	5

B004HYG9V4-0042
The TV in my office finally died	5
so the time came to get a new one.	5
I researched several products	5
and landed on this Sony	5
and boy am I glad	5
I did.	5
From the moment I took it out of the Box I was both surprised and impressed.	5
The stand	7
it came	7
with has a swivel base and the form factor	7
was even thinner	7
than I expected.	7
Then I turned it on...	5
The picture is clear and sharp.	4
The sound is clear as well.	8
It is WiFi enabled	1
which was a	1
must have for me	1
but boy did I under estimate	5
what I was getting with that.	5
Let's just say	5
there is a dedicated button on the remote	0
for accessing Netflix,	0
how cool is that.	5
I just do not have enough time	5
to list all of the amazing features in this review.	5
But the numbers of options available in the on-line area of the Tv are numerous and extremely useful!	0
In summary, this is fantastic TV	5
and was one of my best electronics purchases to date!	5

B00752R89C-0003
Set functioned well for a few months	5
and suddenly was unresponsive to the remote.	3
After a lot of fiddling, we got the remote	3
to do everything	3
but turn it on and off.	3
Now we have to do that manually and sometimes we can get NO SOUND.	8 3
Trouble started after 13 months,	5
but we were away for 2-1/2 months,	5
so the failure happened after just 10-1/2 months of use.	5
Of course, that	5
screwed us for the warranty.	5
Now shopping for a replacement,	5
but NOT A PANASONIC!	5

B00752R89C-0010
I don't use the speakers on this TV.	5
In fact,	5
because the only audio out is optical fiber,	1
I have to connect my rca cables to the DVR.	1
And	5
if I want to watch DVD/blu-ray,	1 3
I have to switch the cables.	1 3
This is a very bad design for a low end TV ;	1
to require high-end audio connection.	1
And	5
if I were to use the TV's speakers,	8
I would probably have shot out the TV by now.	8
They are that bad.	8
Tinny and grating, I got better sound from a transistor radio from the 1960 's.	8
Adjusting bass, treble, etc on this is annoying and only moderately helpful.	8
But the video quality is good	4
and I have no complaints about that.	4
The form factor is also very good.	5
I love	5
how shallow	5
(thin)	5
the profile is,	7
and the bezel is thin, as well.	7
I also give it kudos for the energy efficiency.	5

B00752R89C-0028
I have been a loyal Panasonic owner for years	5
(currently have six Panasonic TVs	5
and have recommended them to many others).	5
HOWEVER, this unit is a great disappointment.	5
The picture is not at all crisp	4
(hooked up to a Direct TV HD receiver)	1 4
and the audio is TERRIBLE!!!	8
Fortunately, with my Direct TV receiver, I can pass the audio directly to my audio system.	5
If I did not have this option,	5
I would have returned the unit.	5
Note,	5
this TV does not come with an analog audio out, only digital,	5
so your output options are limited	5
if you want to listen thru alternative speakers.	8
Panasonic completely missed the boat with this unit.	5
What a shame!!	5

B00752R89C-0039
Repalced my 27 " JVC clunker with this one.	5
It fit perfectly inside our armoir.	5
Good picture, easy to set up and program.	4 3
Decent sound, not great...	8
We have the 42 " version of this set as a Plasma downstairs.	5
Also a solid set.	5

B00752R89C-0075
Great Tv for the price.	6
Easy to setup.	3
The picture is just as good as on my panasonic viera 42 " plasma tv.	4
The audio is ok for the tiny speakers.	8
Good for my bedroom.	5
Much better than the 20 " tube tv.	5

B0077D1LTW-0014
The picture was obviously great	4
but there was a huge buzz directly in front of the screen	8
where I sit about 12-15 feet away.	8
The buzz would overpower any low volume scenes	8
in whatever I was watching.	8
I spoke to Samsung 3 times and	2
while they were very nice and tried to be helpful,	2
their suggestions did not work	2
(tried lowering brightness, contrast, and plug directly into the wall).	5
If you moved away from the center of the TV by even a few feet,	5
the buzz would disappear	8
but I'm not going to watch my new expensive TV from a slight angle.	5
Don't know	5
if I just had a bad TV or all Samsung plasmas are like this	5
but I didn't want to take a chance	5
so I returned this TV after 2 days	5
and have gone with a LED TV.	5
Perfectly quiet now.	5

B0077D1LTW-0017
I had heard about plasmas and their buzzing issues,	5
but since my previous plasma	5
(Panasonic)	5
made no noticeable noise at viewing distance,	5
I went ahead	5
and purchased this Samsung.	5
First impressions were positive.	5
It has an excellent picture,	4
although the automatic brightness adjustment feature is somewhat annoying and can be turned off.	4
It wasn't until I sat on my couch	5
and started watching a show	5
that I started to notice an buzzing sound in my ear.	8
I checked all my connections, no change.	8
This wasn't a quiet hum either.	8
At first I thought	5
it was something	5
I would get used to,	5
but alas I just couldn't bear it	5
so I returned the TV.	5
Maybe mine was faulty	5
but I'm not	5
risking replacing it with another Samsung.	5

B0077D1LTW-0035
The set has fantastic resolution	4
and the price compares very favorably with comparable products.	6
The customer service representatives are very courteous but perhaps not as knowledgeable of the product	2
as they could be.	2
I had to contact the audio device manufacturer	2
to learn how to possibly accomodate the " TV Ears " product.	2
This TV does not offer an audio out with standard RCA.	8
DAC	8
(digital audio converter)	8
was added but unsuccessful	8 2
when following instructions from Samsung rep	8 2
to set to PMA in audio.	8 2
The signal through the cable receiver will function with the TV Ears apparatus	1
but we continue to be unable to receive broadband through the hearing assistance device.. A standard audio out would be a welcome addition to this productThe clicking sound	8 1
when adjusting volume distorts programming	8
until the adjustment is completed.	8
That is annoying and unnecessary,	8
I think.	5
I called customer service	2
and was told there is no setting change	8 2
which will eliminate the click.	8 2

B0077D1LTW-0058
Don't order this	5
if your room is brightly lit.	5
The screen is highly reflective.	4 7
Great picture, amazing sound, Wi-Fi is easy to set up	8 1 4 3
(you need to hard wire temporarily to your router/modem to do it though),	1
and many other really neat features to keep you occupied for hours, days and maybe longer!	5

B0077D1LTW-0094
Very happy with my purchase.	5
Better than the Panasonic it replaced.	5
Vibrant colors.	4
Brightness adjusts automatically.	4 3
Fast response to remote commands.	3
Smart TV with lots of Apps.	0
I prefer wired Network	1
because it is more reliable than the built in WiFi.	1
No problems whatsoever.	5
I would buy it again.	5
I am Tech Savvy	5
and this Samsung TV is an excellent choice.	5

B007IO38MI-0004
I bought this tv for a bedroom.	5
I wanted it to be able to pick up over-the-air stations with an antenna	5
if the cable went down.	5
I placed the tv on a nightstand under a window,	1 3
hooked up the antenna,	5
and attempted to scan for channels.	1 3
After 3 attempts, it was unable to recognize any channels at all!	1 3
An older 10 '' picture tube	5
Sony tv from the 90's in the same location with the same antenna	5
can and still does pick up over 30 stations	5
(with the help of an Insignia digital converter box).	5
When I unhooked the antenna from the Apex tv,	5
the cable input jack snapped off the tv!	5
The cable input jack is the achilles heel of this tv.	5
The design of the tv in the back prevents a straight hookup of a cable wire or antenna	1
without it being kinked.	1
Think twice	5
before buying this tv :	5
the price is enticing,	6
but beware of the design flaw of the input connections.	1

B007IO38MI-0007
The picture quality is very sharp & crisp	4
although the sound is horribley `` tinny '' & squeaky.	8
Like a previous reviewer, I also had to go out	5
and get new, external speakers -- around $ 20 at Staples.	5
These made a world of sound difference,	8
but it was a hassle	5
that I really didn't need.	5
Steve B.	5

B007IO38MI-0011
The TV is great except the sound.	8
The sound seems to come from the back	8
and it is very	8
(tunnel)	8
like.	8
You have to really put on the bass	8
to get a decent sound.	8
The picture is great.	4

B007IO38MI-0016
I was looking for a larger TV for this small room.	5
I had a dvd player and screen in use for years there.	5
So	5
when I got this one	5
it was perfect!	5
The sound is not bad.	8
Great view from the side.	4
Not so much under or above it,	4
but who does that?	5
(oh, I did...	5
lol)	5
Anywho.	5
It's worth the price.	6
Great delivery.	5
No complaints. respect	5

B007IO38MI-0023
I love this TV.	5
The picture is glorious,	4
as if you are	5
looking through a window.	5
It is light, slim, and sleek.	7
The ports are good.	1
The only two downsides of this TV is the sound and the cable connector.	8 1
The cable connection port	1
(or whatever	5
it's called)	5
is very tight.	1
Took a while for me to screw in the wire.	5
The other downside is the sound.	8
The sound from the TV itself is very tiny.	8
I had to purchase computer speakers for it,	5
but now I am totally satisfied.	5
This is a nice affordable TV,	6
that is perfect for a bedroom.	5
Very pleased!!!	5

B007PXV310-0005
We have to watch the TV with the Volume all the way to 64	8
and it sounds the same	8
as ti does at level 35.	8
The remote doesn't work very well either.	3
I would NOT recommend this TV to anyone!	5

B007PXV310-0014
This TV has been one big disappointment.	5
The picture looks very pixelated	4
when playing bluray movies through my HDMI cable	4
which i have tested on another TV.	5
When using it as a monitor	5
using the VGA cable the picture has some fussiness to it	4
and i can see lines across the screen.	4
I sent it back	5
and got	5
a replacement	5
thinking maybe i	5
got a defective one,	5
but the 2nd one had the same issues plus a stuck pixel that i couldnt fix.	4
I will be returning this one today	5
and will be looking for a better brand	5
that will be a little more expensive.	5
I would not recommend this TV to anyone	4
who cares about picture quality.	4

B007PXV310-0020
Easy to set up,	3
picture is good,	4
but sound quality is very poor.	8
There are setting for sound,	8 0
which helped at little,	8 0
but it stills sounds	8
like you are in a tunnel.	8
A home theater sound system might be the answer to this concern,	5
but I have not tried that option yet.	5

B007PXV310-0024
The first TV	5
I received was defective.	5
Although the picture was good,	4
there were so many stuck pixels	4
they became a distraction.	4
With this replacement monitor, I decided to set it up	5
as a PC monitor	5
since my Dell was getting old	5
and was much smaller.	5
I'm really enjoying this unit.	5
It was very easy to set up to the PC,	3
and I was pleased with the bright, clear color.	4
The best thing about it is the size.	7
I do not see well,	5
and I am	5
thrilled with how easy it is to see things on this monitor.	5
I do lots of editing,	5
and this is definitely going to make my life easier.	5
Fortunately, it just fit on my desk	5
and perfectly matches my black PC and printer.	7
I highly recommend it to those of you	5
who have decreased eyesight.	5
You will love it	5
and will never want to work with a small monitor again.	5

B007PXV310-0028
No issues with the Coby TFTV3247 32 inch 1080p 120Hz Widescreen LCD HDTV.	5
Shipped to me in Afghanistan at an APO address,	5
arrived in great shape,	5
packaged carefully.	5
Picture is awesome, zero lag for gaming, plenty of inputs on the back.	1 4
I didn't see any of the old A/V inputs	1
(the Red White and Yellow ones) however.	1
For the price, you won't do any better than this.	6
I've had it for a little over a month now.	5

B0093YV4R2-0002
The sound is mediocre.	8
When the picture is blank,	4
the right side of the screen is blue	5
while the left side is black.	5
This blue " tint " is also visible	4
when viewing programming.	4
While the price was attractive,	6
I would not repeat this purchase.	5

B0093YV4R2-0009
This tv has great picture and sound...	8 4
however the screen is messed up like some others	4
reviewers have mentioned.	5
Large White or faded spots on the screen,	4
which you usually can not see	4
when the picture is colorful and bright,	4
but any dark scenes the foggy, white, large area is quite noticeable.	4
Very frustrating.	5
This is not acceptable for purchasing a new tv	5
as I see it as an investment.	5
You want the quality to be as new and the product	5
to last.	5
I paid for an extended warranty	5
and why do	5
that if the product is faulty from the get go.	5
Disappointed	5

B0093YV4R2-0014
For the price, I'm happy with this	6
(about $ 300 delivered to my door with Prime).	6
However, the sound is lacking.	8
It definitely needs to be fed through a sound system for good movie watching.	8
Also,	5
once you turn it on,	5
it takes so long for the screen	5
to light up	5
that you might turn it off thinking	5
you didn't push the button hard enough the first time.	5
With that said,	5
I'm very happy with the picture and the placement of inputs,	4
etc. is all good.	5

B0093YV4R2-0022
This was our first flat screen Tv purchase.	5
We are very pleased.	5
The picture is great	4
and it has all the features and inputs	5
we need.	5
Only negative is the sound.	8
Has the tinny sound of small speakers.	8
Plan to get a sound bar	5
to remedy the situation.	5
Looking to buy another	5
if the price is right.	5

B0093YV4R2-0034
Easy to set up, nice slim lines, great picture and sound.	8 4 7 3
I have a 47 inch vizio	4
and the picture is as good if not better than that tv.	4
It is everything	5
I could have asked for.	5

B009SJNTIY-0015
I've had this one	5
replaced already	5
once because it starts to get spots after about 6 months.	4
The replacement TV did the exact same thing.	4
Now that I'm beyond warranty I'm stuck with it	5
as the spots get bigger and bigger every day.	4
I used to love the TV,	5
now it just reminds me	5
when I look at it	5
how much I got ripped off.	6
Check any display units in the store,	5
they might have the problem.	5
It only shows	4
when the TV projects white colors.	4
A hockey game is the most obvious way	5
to show them.	5

B009SJNTIY-0025
Very poor picture.	4
I bought this at costco for $ 1450.	6
At home I did a side to side comparison to my 55 " full array Sony.	5
The vizio picture was quite poor in comparison.	4
Very grainy and lousy motion control.	4
I think	5
I will wait for the Vizio P series	5
and see how that looks.	5

I will start off	5
by saying	5
this tv completely fails as a smart tv.	0
It comes preloaded with netflix	0
which would be great except for it lacks the processor speed necessary to actually stream anything.	0
Lacks a net browser and the only thing	0
that I hsve found to work well	0
is pandora.	0
Fortunately this is not	5
why I bought the tv.	5
I got it because of the picture size and price.	4 6
The picture is a good quality	4
and has very little lag watching sports.	4

B009SJNTIY-0046
Good quality and picture but the sports programs	4
I have watched get a little choppy.	4
All in all I am quite happy for the price.	6
It's funny	5
how a massive 70 " tv seemed giant	7
when I got it.	7
Now it seems like a normal size	7
and I want an 85 "!	7

Can't go wrong for a 70 inch led tv for less than $ 1600.	7 6
The quality of the picture is amazing	4
after applying some calibration settings.	4
Colors really pop	4
and blacks are decent for an edge lit led.	4
Don't really notice any motion blur even with soap opera effect	4
turned off.	4
I sit about 9 feet away	5
and it's perfect.	5
Not to big not to small.	7
Delivery guys did	2
an awesome job bring it in the family room	2
and putting it on the stand.	2
I highly recommend this tv to anyone	5
looking for quality at a great price.	6

When I bought this TV,	5
I was looking for a solid 58 ' 120HZ TV	5
without 3D or smart capabilities.	5
I read the reviews	5
and I thought	5
this would be the perfect fit.	5
I was so wrong.	5
Spend the extra couple hundred	5
and buy a TV from a well respected company.	5
Below is the list of my Buyer Beware remarks :	5
The picture quality was worse than my 5 year old LCD Samsung.	4
The TV is not true 120hz.	4
It is the 60hz awkward enhanced magic.	4
Fast moving objects were incredibly pixelated and blotchy.	4
It was very disappointing.	5
The TV died exactly 2 months after purchase.	5
The TV would power on to a black screen.	5
Sending it back to Amazon incurred a 20 % restocking fee.	2
After returning this TV to amazon,	5
I went	5
and bought a LG TV.	5
I could not be happier with the new TV	5
and wish	5
I would not have been such a cheap skate a few months ago.	5

It was great for the first 6 months then all of a sudden it wont turn on,	5
Ive tried different outlets and nothing.	5
Customer service is non	2
existent I was on hold over an hour	2
and finally hung up,	2
TWICE!!	2
Ive tried them on line	2
and the page gets an error message every time.	2
It looks good for the price but its really not worth it.	6
SKIP THIS TRASH!!	5

The TCL TV is an odd mix.	5
The sound is	8
surprisingly very good and for general TV viewing	8
does not need a sound bar.	8
The sound is better	8
than TV's twice its price.	8
The picture however was very disappointing.	4
I struggled	5
for 4 days	5
trying to get this TV	5
is look good.	5
I found	5
that it was inconsistent. 720p cable TV looked	4
washed out but 720p movies	4
that I had ripped looked okay.	4
Blacks were okay,	4
but bright colors generally looked	4
posterized and the " blocks " during up conversion were pretty obvious.	4
Funnily enough the 120hz was great watching a BPL football game.	4
My conclusion after fighting settings was that the TV would be great for sports games and watching my own movies	5
(I can control frame rate etc),	5
but for cable TV not so good.	5
Another issue	5
I had	5
was a loose frame around the LED	5
which led to the light	5
bled around the right edge.	5
I sent the TV back.	5
Great value for $ 499 but not for me.	6

I purchased the 46-inch 60Hz version of this LED several months ago for our bedroom	5
and we loved it...	5
especially for the price.	6
Well,	5
it was time for the living room	5
to get an upgrade	5
and I went directly for the largest TCL LED I could get	5
and this one is it.	5
So far, it's a terrific TV.	5
Good picture,	4
although we don't have anything	5
that can make use of the 120Hz refresh as TV and other media	5
go through a Microsoft Windows Media Center HTPC.	5
It's an absolute `` no-frills '' TV.	5
No `` smart '' capabilities at all and I didn't want them	0
as I have no use for them.	5
Our HTPC, Roku, XBox, and Wii provide all of that for us, and more.	5
If you don't need all the features,	0
but want the size,	7
this TV is a great deal.	5
Keep an eye on the price though... it fluctuates A LOT.	6
You can get it at a really good price	6
if you're patient	5
or aren't in a hurry.	5

Love this TV!	5
No major issues at all.	5
Video is great,	4
sound is great.	8
For the video, I had to use one of the settings.	4
I saw	5
people take off a star or two for for that fact.	5
Who takes off a star	5
because the default settings aren't to their personal preference?	5
The only issue I encounter is an odd one.	5
Sometimes, after changing TV inputs, the screen goes black after a minute or so.	4
I press the input button again,	4
screen goes back to normal.	4
Not a huge deal.	5
Other than that, I strongly recommend this product.	5
The stand	5
it comes with is pretty flimsy, but as long	5
as it is on a proper TV stand,	5
it's no issue.	5
